In contrast to earlier studies, however, they find no relation between artifact size and lateral-displacement distance. The lack of relation between these two variables may be a consequence of defects in experimental design and analysis and should be considered suspect until better controlled data are available.","July 1, 1990","2014-09-18 15:55:37","2014-09-18 15:55:37","2014-09-18 15:55:37","592-594","","3","55","","American Antiquity","Artifact Size and Lateral Displacement under Tillage","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1990 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/MP2MFB54/Dunnell - 1990 - Artifact Size and Lateral Displacement under Tilla.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A state-of-the-art exploration the subject, GIS and Archaeological Site Location Modeling pulls together discussions of theory and methodology, scale, data, quantitative methods, and cultural resource management and uses location models and case studies to illustrate these concepts. This book, written by a distinguished group of international authors, reassesses the practice of predictive modeling as it now exists and examines how it has become useful in new ways.  A guide to spatial procedures used in archaeology, the book provides a comprehensive treatment of predictive modeling. It draws together theoretical models and case studies and explains how modeling may be applied to future projects. The book illustrates the various aspects of academic and practical applications of predictive modeling. It also discusses the need to assess the reliability of the results and the implications of reliability assessment on the further development of predictive models.  Of the books available on GIS, some touch on archaeological applications but few cover the topic in such depth. Both up to date and containing case studies from a wide range of geographical locations including Europe, the USA, and Australia, this book sets a baseline for future developments.""--Publisher's website.","2006","2014-09-18 15:30:16","2014-09-18 15:55:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis","Boca Raton, FL","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","","","Wescott, Konnie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An intellectual tradition is represented throughout these studies, grounded in the assumption that ceramic design variation can be reflected, among other things, in prehistoric social groupings. Within this tradition, a number of differences in method, theory, and application can be distinguished, including (1) the classificatory systems employed, (2) the spatial and temporal scales at which ceramic design variation was studied, and (3) the potential functional role of stylistic attributes on pottery. The debates, both intellectual and social, surrounding the development of method and theory in the New Archaeology are clarified by this historical review, as are the transitions to Culture History and from the New Archaeology in the American Southwest.","December 01, 1998","2011-01-16 22:40:28","2011-01-16 22:40:28","2011-01-16 22:40:28","309-343","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Dec., 1998 / Copyright © 1998 Springer","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/20177390.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By A.D. 860, there may have been more than 10,000 people settled in villages north of the San Juan River in southwest Colorado and southeast Utah. The populations of these villages appear to have come from at least two distinct cultural backgrounds. By A.D. 890, the population of this region had declined by at least two-thirds. Migration of substantial village populations to the south must be considered in any explanation of developments in the subsequent Pueblo II period, including the Chaco phenomenon. /// En el norte del suroeste la etapa Pueblo I (750-900 D.C.) estaba un tiempo drámatico con emigración en gran escala y formación de los primeros pueblos verdaderos.

Using INEGI bedrock maps, optical mineralogy, and sedimentary petrology techniques, I demonstrate that the organization of gray-ware production changed greatly through time at Monte Albán. During the Late-Terminal Formative period (Monte Albán I-II), the majority of the gray wares consumed at Monte Albán were probably imported to this hilltop center from some distance. Furthermore, I found the paste composition of this pottery was highly variable, suggesting that many small-scale part-time specialists were engaged in gray-ware production at this time. With the transition to the Classic period (Monte Albán III-IV), the organization of gray-ware production may have changed dramatically and nearly all of the gray wares recovered from Monte Albán were probably produced at this hilltop center. At the same time, we see extensive evidence of specialized gray-ware production at Monte Albán from both survey and excavation data. /// El siguiente estudio petrográfico de muestras de cerámica gris de Monte Albán se apoyó sobre datos obtenidos de mapas geológicos publicados por INEGI, mineralogía óptica y técnicas de petrología sedimentaria. El análisis petrográfico indica que la organización de la producción de cerámica gris probablemente cambio mucho del período Formativo Tardío al Clásico. Durante el Formativo Tardío (Monte Albán I-II), la mayoría de la cerámica gris empleada en Monte Albán probablemente se importó desde pueblos lejanos del Valle de Oaxaca. Además, nuestros resultados muestran que la composición de la pasta gris era muy variable, sugiriendo la existencia de pequeños grupos que dedicaban parte de su tiempo a su producción. Con la transición al Clásico (Monte Albán III-IV), la organización de producción de la cerámica gris cambió radicalmente ya que casi todos sus restos recolectados en Monte Albán fue con probablemente producidos en el mismo centro. En la misma época, hay mucha evidencia de producción de cerámica gris en Monte Albán procedente de prospecciones y excavaciones con una producción que cambió a una mayor intensificación de especialistas de tiempo completo durante el período Clásico.","September 1, 2007","2013-04-11 18:03:38","2013-04-11 18:03:38","2013-04-11 18:03:38","313-332","","3","18","","Latin American Antiquity","A Microscopic View of Ceramic Production","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2007 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Sep., 2007 / Copyright © 2007 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25478183.pdf?acceptTC=true","ceramics; digital; not read; petrography; production; standardization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its morphology, manufacturing technology and distribution are documented, and it is shown to be a morphologically and technologically consistent point style. Available data indicate that it is limited to southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Temporal data for the Cortaro point are presented and suggest that it may be of late Middle or Late Archaic age. Cortaro points may, therefore, prove to be useful temporal markers and may constitute yet another projectile point style in use in the southern Southwest during the Archaic period.

Jane","Cienega Points and Late Archaic Period Chronology in the Southern Southwest","Kiva","","0023-1940","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/30246296","This paper explores changes in the style and function of two widespread projectile point types during the Late Archaic (1200 B.C.-A.D. 150) period in the southern Southwest. San Pedro and Cienega points, the primary styles associated with the period, have traditionally been assumed to have functioned as dart points. A refined Cienega point typology is proposed here that recognizes four distinct subtypes, which are shown to be chronologically sensitive and functionally distinct. A discriminant analysis of their metrical attributes using Shott's (1997) classification equations suggests that two of the Cienega subtypes may have functioned exclusively as arrow points, while other lines of evidence suggest that the use of San Pedro points as darts, and occasionally as knives, extended beyond the Late Archaic. This indicates that changes in projectile technology, possibly including experimentation with arrows, occurred in the southern Southwest as early as the beginning of the Cienega phase (800 B.C.). /// En este informe se exploran cambios en el estilo y la función de dos tipos de puntas Arcaicas Tardías (1200 a.c.-150 d.c.) en el sur del suroeste norteamericano. Tradicionalmente, las puntas principales asociadas con ests período - puntas Cienega y San Pedro - supuestamente funcionaron como dardos. Aquí se presenta una tipología modificada para las puntas Cienega, reconociendo cuatro distinciones, que demuestran atributos métricos cronológicos y funcionales. Un análisis discriminativo de los atributos métricos de acuerdo con las equasiones de clasificación de Shott (1997) sugiere que dos de los subtipos Cienegapueden haberfuncionado exclusivamente como puntas deflecha, mientras las puntas San Pedro funcionaron como dardos y, de ocasión, como cuchillos, durante el Arcaico Tardío y aún más tarde. Estos datos indican que los cambios de tecnología, incluyendo una experimentación con puntas de flecha, ocurrió en el sur del suroeste al comienzo de la fase Cienega (800 a.c.).","April 1, 1999","2015-03-26 17:56:38","2015-03-26 17:56:38","2015-03-26 17:56:38","339-367","","3","64","","Kiva","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1999 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/30246296.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standards were used to model pottery-making processes as well as raw material properties and variability. Sequential slab construction was found to be a conservative production technology for chaff-or vegetal-tempered wares made from an unplastic, composite mixture of clay, chaff and water. This tradition persevered through the production of fine wares wherein grit temper replaced chaff, and the clay body was aged to become fully plastic. A measure of just how conservative this tradition was can be found in its widespread use at 3000 B.C., and in two examples of modern practice even though the materials and working properties no longer constrained pottery to forming only by s.s.c. The role of other technologies in the development of pottery technology is discussed. Afin de saisir les techniques de fabrication et de production de la poterie utilisées entre 7000 et 3000 avant J.-C, dans le Zagros, région montagneuse du Sud-Ouest asiatique, et afin de spécifier les modes de changement technologique, il fut procédé à l'examen macroscopique de 40 000 fragments et à l'analyse des microstructures de 4 000 tessons. Pour mieux évaluer tant la rapidité des changements technologiques observés que le rôle de certains facteurs contraignants (propriété des argiles, disponibilité des matières premières) et pour mieux apprécier l'importance à accorder aux phénomènes de transmission culturelle, il fut nécessaire de déterminer la structure des argiles, des dégraissants, puis d'entreprendre des simulations et d'analyser les résultats de celles-ci. Trouver et développer certaines normes qui puissent être comparées avec les structures observées dans les poteries anciennes devint une nécessité. Ces normes purent être établies grâce à des simulations faisant appel à certains types de matériaux et de procédés technologiques, à l'observation de leurs effets sur la structure de la poterie, à l'examen de poteries grossières provenant de deux milieux actuels (Cucume en Turquie du Sud-Est et Mehrgarh au Pakistan) et également à celui de la structure de poteries fabriquées avec des techniques utilisées par des artisans et artistes contemporains. Les sites d'où provient la poterie étudiée sont 1) Hajji Firuz, Dalma et Pisdeli tépés dans le nord du Zagros, 2) Ganj Dareh, 3) Sarab, 4) Seh Gabi dans le Zagros central, 5) Choga Sefid, Tepe Sabz, Tepe Farukhabad dans la steppe longeant le Zagros méridional, 6) Tepe Yahya sur le plateau iranien. Pour déterminer l'extension géographique des techniques observées dans le Zagros, de la poterie provenant d'autres sites d'époque néolithique et chalcolithique du Proche-Orient fut examinée : Hassuna, Samarra, Jéricho, Halaf, Chagar Bazar ainsi que celle de sites localisés aux franges de la zone de culture proche-orientale tels que Merimde et Mostegedda en Egypte, Mersin en Turquie du Sud-Est et Mehrgarh près du Bolan Pass au Pakistan.","January 1, 1987","2013-05-19 15:31:56","2013-05-19 15:31:56","2013-05-19 15:31:56","9-35","","2","13","","Paléorient","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1987 Paléorient and CNRS Editions","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: 1987 / Copyright © 1987 Paléorient and CNRS Editions","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/41492252.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, variations in tool size and material texture were presumed to have been related to processing differences between wild and domestic foods. However, recent research conclusions from both the U.S. Southwest and the Levant indicate that tool morphology is more closely related to differing processing strategies than to the food procurement system. Ethnographic accounts of food preparation techniques and tool design experiments provide a foundation for new methods of assessing prehistoric food processing techniques. Food-processing techniques from eight distinct cultural groups in the U.S. Southwest provide examples of how foods might have been incorporated into the prehistoric diet. Experiments with prehistoric food-grinding tool types demonstrate their effectiveness for reducing assorted seeds and maize kernels and helping to identify criteria for a technological analysis of grinding tool types. Archaeological assemblages from selected sites in the U.S. Southwest are evaluated with these criteria and used to discuss the relationship between grinding technology and the introduction of and increasing dependency on agriculture. It is proposed that developments in food-grinding technology are related to processing strategies for incorporating flour into prehistoric diets.","July 1, 1999","2014-09-17 15:07:44","2014-09-17 15:07:44","2014-09-17 15:07:44","475-498","","3","64","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1999 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2694147.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B.C. (calibrated calendrical years before the Christian era) and document the processes by which it was integrated into local foraging economies. Here we review archaeological, paleoecological, linguistic, and genetic data to evaluate the hypothesis that Proto-Uto-Aztecan (PUA) farmers migrating from a homeland in Mesoamerica introduced maize agriculture to the region. We conclude that this hypothesis is untenable and that the available data indicate instead a Great Basin homeland for the PUA, the breakup of this speech community into northern and southern divisions ≈6900 cal. B.C. and the dispersal of maize agriculture from Mesoamerica to the US Southwest via group-to-group diffusion across a Southern Uto-Aztecan linguistic continuum.","12/15/2009","2015-08-27 15:48:50","2015-08-27 15:48:50","2015-08-27 15:48:50","21019-21026","","50","106","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 19995985","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/5PU3W9MQ/Merrill et al. - 2009 - The diffusion of maize to the southwestern United .pdf; ; /home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/8U264C4P/21019.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995985","","early agriculture; Mesoamerica; migration; US Southwest; Uto-Aztecan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This perspective is used as a basis for analyzing chronological changes in designs on Mimbres Black-on-white pottery (ca. AD 750-1150) from Southwest New Mexico. Specific focus is on a methodology that can be used to detect innovations, that is, the introduction of novel designs that are incorporated into the design corpus and thus transform the structure. The conceptualization of a particular tradition (in this instance, pottery painting) as a form of structure analogous to general structure in Giddens' sense thus provides important insights into the recursive relationship between agency and structure.","2005","2011-01-16 22:46:24","2011-01-17 19:06:34","2011-01-16 22:46:24","313-334","","4","12","","","Painting as Agency, Style as Structure","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Agency: Methodologies for Interpreting Social Reproduction, Part 2 / Full publication date: Dec., 2005 / Copyright © 2005 Springer","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/20177523.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mechanics of flake formation are directly relevant to the identification of prehistoric flaking techniques and stone tool use. In this paper we provide a model of flake formation that accounts for much of the variation in flake morphology. Flakes can form in a number of ways and despite popular belief they are not all of the conchoidal variety. The bending flake is common in use wear though it is often misidentified as a conchoidal flake. A third major type of flake, the compression flake, is a common product of bipolar impact. To account for the wide variation in flake morphology we follow a tripartite scheme of flake formation comprising initiation, propagation, and termination phases, within which different mechanisms can operate.","1987","2015-08-05 22:24:54","2015-08-17 21:02:17","2015-08-05 22:24:54","675-708","","4","52","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1987 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/281378.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, no method of measuring use lives directly from archaeological remains has been developed. However, this important quantity may be related to elementary properties of tool classes such as size and weight, properties which are themselves directly measurable. Ethnographic data on ceramic vessels, in which use life is related to such properties, is described and analyzed. Using!Kung San and Ingalik data, a similar analysis is performed for a variety of nonceramic tools and objects, although few of the stone-tool classes common to archaeological assemblages are included. There, use life is related most strongly to manufacturing cost and curation rate, an archaeological measure of which is proposed. Neither is an elementary property, but they can be estimated accurately for many tool classes. These results are noteworthy but not definitive, and they underscore the continued value of museum ethnographic collections and ethnoarchaeological research.","January 1, 1989","2015-08-21 17:23:35","2015-08-21 17:23:35","2015-08-21 17:23:35","9-30","","1","54","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1989 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/281329.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is in contrast to many traditional analytical methods oriented toward identifying the effects of lithic reduction techniques on individual flakes. Debate over the use of the typology has focused primarily on the ability of the typology to accurately measure variation in lithic reduction behavior, and secondarily on the role of experimental studies in archaeology. In this paper I present an analysis designed to estimate the reliability and validity of the typology. An experimental design is developed to permit data collection with minimal analyst induced random or systematic error. Principal components analysis and the coefficient theta demonstrate that the typology provides reliable or replicable results when applied to debitage assemblages of similar technological origin. Further principal components analysis suggests that the instrument is of limited utility in recognizing effects of variation in reduction activities associated with highly vitreous lithic raw materials. A means of expanding the typology and increasing its accuracy in archaeological pattern recognition is presented.","October 1, 1998","2015-08-17 21:28:04","2015-08-17 21:28:04","2015-08-17 21:28:04","635-650","","4","63","","American Antiquity","The Reliability and Validity of a Lithic Debitage Typology","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1998 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/2694112.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines some approaches to the statistical analysis of data arising from both kinds of techniques, including ‘mixed-mode’ methods where both types of data are incorporated into analysis. The approaches are illustrated using data derived from 88 Late Bronze Age transport jars from Kommos, Crete.

The development of Aboriginalism is explored as a mutually reinforcing process between Indigenous and Western scholars, based on evidence that is at best anecdotal. The adoption of this flawed concept by archaeologists, Western publics, and Indigenous people themselves has led to problematic assumptions that have negative consequences for both the practice of archaeology and for the lives of those who identify themselves as Indigenous. Archaeologists can usefully challenge the historical assumptions on which the paradigm of Aboriginalism is based: the belief that local societies have endured as stable entities over great periods of time, and the consequent projection of contemporary ethnic identities into the deep past. Such a challenge confronts a significant element of the intellectual climate that allows marginalized groups to exist as permanent aliens in the societies of settler nations. /// Este trabajo sostiene que los proponentes de diferentes formas de ""arqueología indígena"" basan sus argumentos en un paradigma de esencialismo aborigen (""aboriginalismo"") que se desprende del concepto, desterrado hace tiempo, del hombre primitivo. El desarrollo del aboriginalismo se examina desde la perspectiva de un proceso mutuamente complementario entre los especialistas indígenas y occidentales, basado en la evidencia que es, a lo sumo, anecdótica. La aceptación de este concepto viciado por parte de los arqueólogos, el público y la propia población indígena, ha llevado al establecimiento de hipótesis problemáticas que influyen de forma negativa tanto en la práctica de la arqueología como en la vida de los que se identifiquen como indígenas. Los arqueólogos pueden cuestionar con eficacia las hipótesis históricas en las que se fundamenta el paradigma del aboriginalismo: la presunción de que las sociedades locales han sido históricamente estables y perdurables durante largos períodos de tiempo, y la proyección de las identidades étnicas actuales en el pasado. Para ello, abordaremos un elemento importante del clima intelectual que permite a las sociedades marginadas seguir existiendo como extranjeros permanentes en las sociedades de las naciones coloniales.","October 01, 2008","2011-05-01 16:34:30","2011-05-01 16:34:30","2011-05-01 16:34:30","579-597","","4","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Oct., 2008 / Copyright © 2008 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25470519.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With its emphasis on modernity, historical archaeology of this persuasion overlooks historical archaeologies concerned with revising metanarratives that misrepresent African pasts. We argue that historical archaeologists need to listen to local histories, often held in oral form, and that the appropriate task of historical archaeology is making histories that include, not exclude, local historicities. A critical historical archaeology in Africa is illustrated by cases in which oral traditions play a central role in unveiling the historical significance of archaeological remains as well as circumstances in which careful readings of archaeology and local histories subvert standard histories based on outsiders' interpretations and observations. We draw case studies from the Swahili Coast, Great Zimbabwe, the Kalahari, and the Cwezi period of the Great Lakes. Our approach accepts that if archaeologists employ materiality--regardless of its chronological age--to transform historical representation, then such historical revision creates a more comprehensive practice for historical archaeology, a matter of vital interest for both history and anthropology. /// Hace tiempo que la arqueología histórica de Africa hace hincapié sobre fuentes europeas y sobre el impacto del imperialismo y del colonialismo sobre los pueblos africanos. Con tal enfoque sobre la modernidad, este género de arqueología histórica corre el riesgo de pasar por alto otros géneros de investigación orientada hacia la corrección de representaciones tergiversadas del pasado africano. El presente artículo sostiene que les incumbe a los arqueólogos escuchar historias locales, incluyendo las orales, y que el papel de la arqueología histórica es el de crear historias que incluyan, no excluyan, versiones históricas locales. Damos un ejemplo de tal arqueología histórica crítica mediante el examen de casos en los cuales las tradiciones orales juegan un papel central en el descubrimiento del significado histórico de los restos arqueológicos. Damos ejemplos también de la manera en que la interpretacion cuidadosa de la arqueología y de las historias locales puede corregir las historias convencionales basadas en las interpretaciones y observaciones hechas por forasteros. Se utilizan estudios de caso de la Costa Swahili, de Zimbabwe Mayor, de Kalahari, y del período Cwezi de los Grandes Lagos. Este enfoque parte de la premisa de que los materiales arqueológicos, no importa su edad cronológica, pueden emplearse para la transformación de la representación histórica, y que tal reinterpretación histórica permite más amplitud en la práctica de la arqueología histórical.

The Savage homestead settlement history is investigated through dendrochronological, documentary, archaeological, and oral history data. The assembled data testify to the tenacity and strength of a widow with six children subsisting in the isolation of the high desert of New Mexico and threading her way through the federal paperwork maze to earn a homestead patent—a task accomplished, but an occupation that was short-lived.

Severe erosion has drastically bisected the Puerco valley with four primary arroyos entering the western side of the Guadalupe reach of the valley: Tapia, Salado, Guadalupe and “No Name.” We recorded an 11-m-tall alluvial sequence marked by four phases of cumulic soil development, interrupted by six major periods of channel entrenchment that occurred at about 4100–3700 B.C. and 2900–2400 B.C., between 2200 B.C. and ca. A.D. 400, pre- and post-ca. A.D. 900–1300, and in the late A.D. 1800s. Relative floodplain stability and associated cumulic soil development occurred prior to ca. 5700 B.C., between ca. 2600 to 2200 B.C. and A.D. 350 and 550, and ca. A.D. 900–1300. Multiple signatures of fires (oxidized sediment and charcoal) were observed in the Arroyo Tapia tributary sequence, especially in deposits dated ca. 6000 and 2600 B.C. These fires may have helped to enhance food resources for game animals by encouraging grass and shrub growth and/or to increase the growth of wild plants and eventually cultigens such as maize.

The associated appearance, dissemination, and subsequent disappearance of the pottery known as Salado Polychrome has until now been poorly understood. Crown's exhaustive study provides evidence of a Southwestern Regional Cult, an ideology that unified the disparate groups who came to share the region and resulted in the manufacture of the distinctive pottery over a wide area. In the most comprehensive study ever undertaken on southwestern pottery, the author examines the context of the recovery of vessels, their probable use, the imagery of the designs, evidence for the mode of production, and independent evidence for the existence of a new religious ideology. Her results suggest the presence of an inclusive ideology that helped to stabilize social relations during this time of upheaval and change in the prehistoric Southwest. Ceramics and Ideology contributes to both the theory and methodology of the study of the greater Southwest.","1994","2014-09-17 15:21:31","2014-09-17 15:21:31","","","","","","","","Ceramics and ideology","","","","","University of New Mexico Press","Albuquerque","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical bases for this conclusion are shifts in mobility, subsistence, and technology. Paleoarchaic peoples are described as highly mobile, focused on a diversity of animal resources, including birds and small game, and using more exotic toolstone, an aspect of mobility. In contrast, Early Archaic strategies are less mobile, yet more focused on large game, using more local toolstone, and adopting grinding tools presumably to process small seeds. Accompanying this transition is the shift from stemmed to notched projectile points. Data bearing on this transition on the Colorado Plateau have been scarce. Excavations of finely stratified deposits at North Creek Shelter on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah have yielded support for the adaptive discontinuity position, although qualitative differences between the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau are apparent in mobility and faunal use. Literatura reciente sobre las estrategias Paleo Arcaico y Arcaico Temprano en el oeste árido de Norte América (principalmente el Great Basin) ha caracterizado el cambio de la época temprano a más tarde como constituyendo una discontinuidad adoptiva. El base empírico para esta conclusión son cambios en la movilidad, la subsistencia, y la tecnología. Gente Paleo Arcaico son representados como altamente móvil, enfocado en una diversidad de recursos animales, incluyendo aves, y animales pequeños de caza, y confiando en toolstone más exóticas, un aspecto de movilidad. Al contrario, estrategias del Arcaico Temprano son menos móvil, pero más enfocados en animales grades de caza, usando más herramientas de piedra local, y adoptando herramientas de moler, presumiblemente para preparar semillas pequeñas. Acompañando a esta transición es el cambio de pie a mella de puntos proyéctales. Datos apoyando esta transición en el Colorado Plateau han sido muy escasos. Las excavaciones de depósitos vena-fina a North Creek Shelter en el sur de Utah han producido apoyo por la posición de discontinuidad adoptiva, sin embargo diferencias cualitativas entre el Great Basin y el Colorado Plateau son evidentes en la movilidad y en el uso de fauna.","January 1, 2012","2015-09-03 15:58:42","2015-09-03 15:58:42","2015-09-03 15:58:42","125-159","","1","77","","American Antiquity","THE PALEOARCHAIC TO EARLY ARCHAIC TRANSITION ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2012 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/B6XMAGIH/Janetski et al. - 2012 - THE PALEOARCHAIC TO EARLY ARCHAIC TRANSITION ON TH.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These cultural resource management (CRM) studies include several landmark projects that helped shape the national approach to African American archaeology. However, as with other sectors of the discipline, CRM archaeology of the African diaspora is presently suffering from a period of stagnation and lack of focus. This paper considers CRM's contribution to the archaeology of African America, past and present, and attempts to project the future place of CRM in the study of the African American past.","January 01, 2004","2011-01-24 15:10:16","2011-01-24 15:10:16","2011-01-24 15:10:16","18-31","","1","38","","","Resistance and Compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Transcending Boundaries, Transforming the Discipline: African Diaspora Archaeologies in the New Millenium / Full publication date: 2004 / Copyright © 2004 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25617129.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From small-scale, simply organized, prehistoric Pueblo societies, a complex and socially differentiated political system emerged which has become known as the Chaco Phenomenon. The origins, evolution, and decline of this system have long been the subject of intense archaeological debate. In her book, The Chaco Anusazi: Sociopolitical evolution in the prehistoric Southwest, Lynne Sebastian examines the transition of the Chaco system from an acephalous society, in which leadership was situational and most decision making carried out within kinship structures, to a hierarchically organized political structure with institutional roles of leadership. She argues that harsh environmental factors did not provide the catalyst for such a transition, as has previously been thought. Rather the increasing political complexity was a consequence of improved rainfall in the region which permitted surplus production, thus allowing those farming the best land to capitalize on their material success. By combining information on political evolution with archaeological data and the results of a computer simulation, the author is able to produce a sociopolitically based model of the rise, florescence, and decline of the Chaco Phenomenon.","1992","2014-09-17 15:48:08","2015-08-25 22:32:43","","","","","","","","The Chaco Anasazi","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7WNIGW2T","book","2003","Gavin, Robin Farwell; Pierce, Donna; Pleguezuelo, Alfonso","Cerámica Y Cultura","","978-0-8263-3102-1","","","","Brought to Spain in the thirteenth century by Islamic artisans, the enameled earthenware known as mayólica is decorated with a lead glaze to which tin oxide is added to create an opaque white surface. By the fifteenth century, several areas in Spain were well known throughout Europe for the quality of these ceramics, and with Spain's expansion into the New World the mayólica tradition came into Mexico. There it underwent further changes, notably the use of indigenous design motifs and patterns inspired by Chinese porcelain. Over the next three centuries, the potters of New Spain produced ceramics characterized by a distinctive mestizo aesthetic. This tradition continues today in both Mexico and Spain. Assembled in connection with a major exhibition at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, this book moves discussion of mayólica beyond its stylistic merits in order to understand it in historic and cultural context. The contributors, specialists in art and art history, architecture, anthropology, archaeology, and the folk arts, place the ceramics in history and daily life, illustrating their place in trade and economics. Examining both historic and contemporary examples, they also take us into the potters' workshops.","2003","2013-04-07 15:45:50","2013-04-07 15:45:50","","","394","","","","","","","","","","UNM Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=IHdoCDr_JaEC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the example of ceramic technology we consider how materials science studies can contribute to and benefit from this understanding of technology as a social construct. Although we acknowledge some potential difficulties, it is our contention that both materials scientists and archaeologists have gained much and have much to gain by cooperating together to study ancient technologies, and that the concept of ‘technological choices’can facilitate a wider consideration of the factors shaping technological developments.","2000/02/01","2011-05-01 21:50:49","2011-05-01 21:50:49","2011-05-01 21:50:49","2-20","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"8AN5T6NE","book","2009","Fagan, Brian","The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations","","978-1-59691-601-2","","","","A breakout bestseller on how the earth’s previous global warming phase reshaped human societies from the Arctic to the Sahara—a wide-ranging history with sobering lessons for our own time. From the tenth to the fifteenth century the earth experienced a rise in surface temperature that changed climate worldwide—a preview of today’s global warming. In some areas, including western Europe, longer summers brought bountiful harvests and population growth that led to cultural flowering. In the Arctic, Inuit and Norse sailors made cultural connections across thousands of miles as they traded precious iron goods. Polynesian sailors, riding new wind patterns, were able to settle the remotest islands on earth. But in many parts of the world, the warm centuries brought drought and famine. Elaborate societies in western and central America collapsed, and the vast building complexes of Chaco Canyon and the Mayan Yucatán were left empty. The history of the Great Warming of a half millennium ago suggests that we may yet be underestimating the power of climate change to disrupt our lives today—and our vulnerability to drought, writes Fagan, is the “silent elephant in the room.”","March 3, 2009","2014-09-18 15:54:48","2014-09-18 15:54:48","","","304","","","","","The Great Warming","","","","","Bloomsbury Press","","English","","","","","Amazon.com","","","","","http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Warming-Climate-Civilizations/dp/159691601X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411055689&sr=8-1&keywords=Brian+Fagan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reprint edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What has been ignored in these discussions is the presence of an early record in the region associated not with Clovis, but with a different technology, the main diagnostic of which is the large, contracting stemmed projectile point. Dates associated with this technology are comparable to the earliest Clovis dates on the Plains. An examination of the spatial and temporal distributions of Clovis diagnostics suggests that elements of this technology arrived relatively late in the Intermountain West, apparently the termination of a diffusion (or migration) process that began in the southern Plains or Southeast, moved northward along the Rocky Mountain front, and eventually onto the Columbia Plateau. We argue that initial colonization of the intermountain region most likely involved groups moving inland from the Pacific coast carrying a non-Clovis technology, which was already in place by the time Clovis technology arrived. /// El oeste de Intermountain se incluye raramente en discusiones del expediente norteamericano de Paleoindian, en gran parte porque hay tan poca evidencia para Clovis en esa región. Qué se ha no hecho caso en estas discusiones es la presencia de un expediente temprano en la región asociada no a Clovis, sino a una diversa tecnología, el diagnóstico principal de la cual es el grande, punto provenido del proyectil que contrae. Las fechas asociadas a esta tecnología son comparables a las fechas más tempranas de Clovis en los llanos. Una examinación de las distribuciones espaciales y temporales del diagnóstico de Clovis sugiere que los elementos de esta tecnología llegaran relativamente tarde en el Intermountain al oeste, al parecer la terminación de un proceso de la difusión (o migración) que comenzó en los llanos meridionales o al sureste, movido hacia el norte a lo largo del frente rocoso de la montaña, y eventual sobre la meseta de Colombia. Discutimos esa colonización inicial de la mudanza implicada más probable de los grupos de la región del intermountain interior desde la costa pacífica que lleva una tecnología de los non-Clovis, que estaba ya en lugar para el momento en que llegara la tecnología de Clovis.","January 1, 2010","2015-09-11 16:01:47","2015-09-11 16:01:47","2015-09-11 16:01:47","81-116","","1","75","","American Antiquity","Clovis and Western Stemmed","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2010 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/TUUBTR7B/Beck and Jones - 2010 - Clovis and Western Stemmed Population Migration a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Debates about constructionism, neo-tribal capitalism, and proprietary approaches to culture provide valuable insights into recent indigenous cultural claims and political struggles, but also have serious limitations. The approach taken in the article, ‘tribal synthesis’, emphasizes process, agency, interdependence, and changing political and cultural repertoires of native peoples who seek survival amidst political domination and internal conflict. Such an approach can apply the best of recent critical theory in an advocacy anthropology that supports indigenous struggles.","2006","2013-04-15 02:27:23","2013-04-15 02:27:23","2013-04-15 02:27:23","293–311","","2","12","","","Tribal synthesis","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","; ","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.unm.edu/store/10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00292.x/asset/j.1467-9655.2006.00292.x.pdf?v=1&t=hfj0veg2&s=2e925babff7675edc8fa2505fb5bec56132c181f; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.unm.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00292.x/abstract","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early Scotland has left few contemporary documents and is therefore only barely historical; consequently archaeology has always played a significant role in the study of its origins. That role has generally been to provide illustrations for historical discussions, especially in the case of the Picts who occupied what was to become the core of the Scottish state. This study suggests how the archaeological evidence can be used to go beyond mere illustration and beyond the limitations of the aristocratic interests which are embodied in the contemporary sources and to begin writing a representative social history. The concept of fields of discourse is used to provide a materialist method for integrating texts and artifacts. Attention here is focused on the architecture of the hillforts, the significance of the Symbol Stones, and on the settlement patterns as revealed by aerial photography.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-24 15:32:46","2011-01-24 15:32:46","2011-01-24 15:32:46","12-25","","3","26","","","Discourse on the Frontiers of History","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Meanings and Uses of Material Culture / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616173.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I use these measures to monitor changes in agricultural processing at archaeological sites in western New Mexico. The patterns identified suggest that the importance of agriculture fluctuated through time, increasing substantially only in the Late Pueblo period. Comparisons of grinding assemblages among sites show marked differences in the amount of agricultural products processed at a given location within a given time period. These component-specific patterns may reflect different settlement types, or variable levels of agricultural dependence on a short temporal scale. /// Este Artículo aprovecha recientes trabajos experimentales, etnográficos y etnohistóricos para desarrollar razonamientos que relacionan el área de molienda en las manos, la alta frecuencia de manos con multiples caras, y cambios en las formas de los metates, con la intensificación de las actividades agrícolas. Se usan estas medidas para rastrear cambios en los procesos agrícolas en sitios arqueológicos del oeste de Nuevo Mexico. Los patrones identificados, sugieren que la importancia de la agricultura fluctuó atraves del tiempo, y solo incrementó substancialmente a finales del periodo Pueblo Tardío.

However, the panel has become warped over time and there is a join on the left side, where it has suffered a break in the past. It has been connected with two metal pins and adhesive in a previous conservation treatment but there is now concern that these could be having an adverse influence on natural movements within the ivory. Given the importance of the panel, the decision was made to leave the pins in place and monitor the stability of the panel. As the geometry of the panel is complex, it was felt that microscopic imaging would not be suitable and 3D laser scanning was used instead. This engineering metrology technique is increasingly used in cultural heritage and conservation to record minute three-dimensional changes with high spatial accuracy. The resulting dataset is a detailed metric 3D record of the object surface in-the-round and comparison of subsequent scans with a reference scan can indicate dimensional changes. As part of a monitoring campaign, the ivory panel was first scanned in January 2012 to provide a reference scan. It was then scanned again in autumn 2012 (no significant movement was detected) and will be scanned at regular intervals in the future. This case study demonstrates the potential of","AUG 2015","2015-09-29 18:43:37","2015-09-29 18:43:37","","S126-S133","","","60","","Stud.

The subject of analysis is indigenous objects that depict European colonizers; such material culture should provide a sensitive insight into indigenous perceptions of colonization and illuminate the relations between various colonizers and indigenous peoples throughout the world.

(Repr.)","","978-0-521-29164-4","","","","Outline of a Theory of Practice is recognized as a major theoretical text on the foundations of anthropology and sociology. Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.","1977-06-30","2011-11-06 17:47:21","2011-11-06 17:47:21","","","260","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=WvhSEMrNWHAC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expanding upon the research done for their first two books (Blue Ridge China Today and Blue Ridge China Traditions), the authors provide a comprehensive, pictorial review of these beautiful, hand-decorated wares.  Written with young and future collectors in mind, the book contains a special focus on exciting children's pieces made at the pottery. In addition, collectors of all ages will find an extensive assortment of the wide-ranging dinnerware and china pieces for which Blue Ridge is so well known. Included are many newly identified patterns, newly discovered pieces, and different pieces and shapes for some ""old favorite"" patterns.  The invaluable appendix contains pattern numbers, matching glassware, backstamps, and a new section featuring many of the original rubber stamps used at the pottery. Suggested prices in the captions and a separate Price Guide are based on the authors' careful and constant monitoring of sales from the Internet, auctions, antique malls, and garage sales. This is a delightful celebration of the timeless and much-loved Blue Ridge China.","2004","2015-02-03 17:47:51","2015-02-03 17:48:08","","","224","","","","","","","","","","Schiffer Pub Ltd","Atglen, PA","English","","","","","Amazon.com","","","","","http://www.amazon.com/Ridge-China-Treasures-Schiffer-Collectors/dp/0764321625/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422985143&sr=8-1&keywords=Blue+ridge+China+Treasures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These field studies revealed portions of two of the city's late 18th- and 19th-century barrios: Santo Domingo, one of the wealthier barrios in the old city, and Ballajá, the city's 19th-century slum. The late 18th century witnessed Puerto Rico's entry into a world economy, as trade restrictions were relaxed and goods from beyond the Spanish empire first legally reached the island. The analysis of materials from the Ballajá project indicates that three trading spheres existed during this period: (1) materials produced from outside the Spanish realm, (2) items produced by Spain and her colonies, and (3) items produced locally in Puerto Rico. Participation in each of these trade networks appears to have been linked to social and economic status, with the upper-status occupants of the project area focused on non-Hispanic materials, the middle-status inhabitants relying upon non-local Hispanic goods, and the lower-status residents dependent on locally-produced items. This article examines the relations between socio-economics and trade in 18th- and 19th-century Old San Juan, and discusses the implications of the observed patterns for understanding the colonial Hispanic economy.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-24 15:25:14","2011-01-24 15:25:14","2011-01-24 15:25:14","45-58","","1","26","","","Socio-Economics and Trade in Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: The Archaeology of the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republican Periods / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616141.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work prompted questions about why cordage production processes seem to be so conservative. Recent research demonstrates that handedness, fiber type, and spinning technique probably do not determine cordage twist direction. The results indicate, instead, that participation in communities of practice or learning networks, the automatization of motor skills, and the practicalities of production have important effects. This paper also examines learning and motor-skill development as factors in conservative cordage production behavior and then interprets cordage twist direction distributions in the prehistoric Southeast from this perspective.</p>","December 01, 2001","2011-04-28 23:01:02","2011-04-28 23:01:02","2011-04-28 23:01:02","381-405","","4","57","","","Motor Skills and the Learning Process","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Learning and Craft Production / Full publication date: Winter, 2001 / Copyright © 2001 University of New Mexico","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3631352.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding relationships between continental-scale patterns of drought and modes of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may explain how interannual to multidecadal variability in SSTs drives fire at continental scales. We used local wildfire chronologies reconstructed from fire scars on tree rings across western North America and independent reconstructions of SST developed from tree-ring widths at other sites to examine the relationships of multicentury patterns of climate and fire synchrony. From 33,039 annually resolved fire-scar dates at 238 sites (the largest paleofire record yet assembled), we examined forest fires at regional and subcontinental scales. Since 1550 CE, drought and forest fires covaried across the West, but in a manner contingent on SST modes. During certain phases of ENSO and PDO, fire was synchronous within broad subregions and sometimes asynchronous among those regions. In contrast, fires were most commonly synchronous across the West during warm phases of the AMO. ENSO and PDO were the main drivers of high-frequency variation in fire (interannual to decadal), whereas the AMO conditionally changed the strength and spatial influence of ENSO and PDO on wildfire occurrence at multidecadal scales. A current warming trend in AMO suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades.","01/09/2007","2014-10-09 19:09:04","2014-10-13 14:55:55","2014-10-09 19:09:04","543-548","","2","104","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 17197425","","; ; ","http://www.pnas.org/content/104/2/543.full.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17197425; http://www.pnas.org/content/104/2/543.full","","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; El Niño Southern Oscillation; fire history network; ocean warming; Pacific Decadal Oscillation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because sample size is controlled for, collections of different sizes can be directly compared in a simple graphical display. Because of its rigor and simplicity, this method serves to focus interpretive attention on issues of anthropological (rather than methodological) importance. Examples from the archaeological literature are used to illustrate the operation and potential applicability of this method to a wide range of archaeological problems.","January 1, 1984","2013-08-09 22:19:22","2013-08-09 22:19:22","2013-08-09 22:19:22","44-54","","1","49","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1984 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jan., 1984 / Copyright © 1984 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/280511.pdf?acceptTC=true","diversity; methods; not read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually the artefacts are characterized by their chemical composition. Here the focus is on cluster analysis of compositional data. Using Euclidean distances cluster analysis is closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) that is a frequently used multivariate projection technique in archaeometry. Since PCA and cluster analysis based on Euclidean distances are scale dependent, some kind of “appropriate” data transformation is necessary. Some different techniques of data preparation will be presented. We consider the log-ratio transformation of Aitchison and the transformation into ranks in more detail. From the statistical point of view the latter is a robust method.","2008/01/01","2013-08-09 20:05:44","2013-08-09 20:05:44","2013-08-09 20:05:44","681-688","","","","","","","Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","©2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu","","","","; ","http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78246-9_80.pdf; http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78246-9_80","cluster analysis; data analysis; digital link; not read","","Preisach, Christine; Burkhardt, Professor Dr Hans; Schmidt-Thieme, Professor Dr Lars; Decker, Professor Dr Reinhold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is considerable variation in intensity, output, and scale among potting house-holds in two communities. The paper evaluates the utility of two kinds of potential material indicators for this variation: 1) spatial organization for different steps in production (forming vessels, preparing clay, drying vessels, firing), and 2) degree of vessel uniformity. Although degree of uniformity of vessels does vary with intensity for some dimensions, other factors such as experience of the potter and consumer demand need to be considered. Material features of production areas are more obvious indicators of variation in intensity and output.","2003","2011-01-16 22:45:13","2011-01-16 22:45:13","2011-01-16 22:45:13","203-275","","3","10","","","Investigating Variation in Organization of Ceramic Production","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Sep., 2003 / Copyright © 2003 Springer","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/20177480.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long charged, sociopolitical context has also affected research questions, as well as public interpretations, about the past. Today, there are calls for a new past for the new South Africa. Historical archaeology can provide both a methodology and raw materials which South Africans can use to form their own interpretations of their past helping, in turn, to engender pride through a historical consciousness emancipated from colonial and apartheid ideology. This article presents an overview of this complex and changing research context and its implications for a historical archaeology study of South African frontier identity. Research and ""public"" archaeology efforts concerning material and mythical perspectives of ethnicity are discussed. Employed in a cross-context comparison with African-American research, this study highlights the need for decolonized historical archaeology outreach.","January 01, 1997","2011-01-24 15:14:29","2011-01-24 15:14:29","2011-01-24 15:14:29","65-82","","3","31","","","""Leveling the Playing Field"" in the Contested Territory of the South African Past","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: In the Realm of Politics: Prospects for Public Participation in African-American and Plantation Archaeology / Full publication date: 1997 / Copyright © 1997 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616549.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geoarchaeological coring at the Mockingbird Gap (Clovis) site, New Mexico, resulted in the recovery of a small tubular bead of Paleoindian age. The bead was found in alluvial sand 9.20 m below the surface of Chupadera Draw, an intermittent drainage that borders the site. The ornament is made of calcium carbonate and is the only known Paleoindian bead of this material in North America. All known tubular beads of this age are bone. Other beads are made of shell or teeth. The bead probably was made by using a rotary drill to modify a segment of a rhizolith, which is a cemented calcium carbonate cylinder representing root molds. Beads could easily be made from these cylinders although they would be relatively fragile, likely accounting for their rarity. The bead has a minimum age of ∼10,550 14C years BP. This suggests a Folsom association. Scattered Folsom sites are known within 1 km of the site. The Clovis occupation is more extensive and intensive, however, and within 120 m of the findspot.","February 1, 2013","2015-08-07 19:27:08","2015-08-07 19:27:08","2015-08-07 19:27:08","85-95","","1","54","","Current Anthropology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2013 The University of Chicago Press","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.1086/668654.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Archaeologists, historians, and historical sociologists writing on the topic have accepted a model which stresses the dependence created by the Spanish mercantile system. By contrast, the analysis of archaeological data described herein indicates that before 1856 the military colonies (presidios) enjoyed comparative self-sufficiency. During late colonial times (1750-1821) nearly all of the limited amounts of goods imported to the frontier were manufactured in central New Spain. After 1830 this pattern changed, and increasing amounts of European products replaced those made in Mexico. Eventually, the expansion of the industrialized world economy culminated in the creation of recognizable bonds of dependency that linked the presidios to European-dominated capitalism.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-16 23:02:23","2011-01-16 23:02:23","2011-01-16 23:02:23","7-21","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: The Archaeology of the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republican Periods / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616138.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In provenance studies, petrographic and chemical analyses of the ceramic materials are employed to investigate potential production areas in respect to the geolocial background. Moreover, also the production technology of the firing process, as well as the forming techniques used by the prehistoric potters are of great interest. Their investigation is most often accompanied by a destructive preparation of the samples. In this paper, we want to present high-resolution X-ray microtomography (μ-CT), a non-destructive and non-invasive method, as a supplementary research tool in the study of prehistoric pottery. Ceramic fragments from the Endmesolithic–Neolithic site Hamburg-Boberg 15 (northern Germany) were analysed by X-ray microtomography. μ-CT inspection combines quantification and shape analysis of fabric components by means of computer aided image processing. As the μ-CT method is sensitive to material densities, qualitative and quantitative analyses of different temper materials are possible. Furthermore, the μ-CT method permits the characterisation of the connectivity within the porous system, as well as the analysis of the orientation of the pore structures, which are indicative for vessel forming techniques. Although limited by the resolution of the reconstructed images, distribution analysis of heavy minerals in the clay matrix can offer distinctive features to discriminate various clay sources. Moreover, X-ray microtomography can be used to infer the nature of organic temper even with all plant remains completely burnt out during the firing process. The visualisation of the high-resolution true volume renderings and their detailed morphometric characterisation enables new avenues in the study of ceramic technology.","July 2012","2013-11-02 16:38:00","2013-11-02 16:38:00","2013-11-02 16:38:00","2206-2219","","7","39","","Journal of Archaeological Science","Non-destructive fabric analysis of prehistoric pottery using high-resolution X-ray microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science/article/pii/S0305440312000933/pdfft?md5=8d6a5d44b1c20961e98997ba6bc764ac&pid=1-s2.0-S0305440312000933-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science/article/pii/S0305440312000933","not read; vessel formation; xrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is believed that by emphasizing this area to the exclusion of all others the cultural phenomenon being examined has been unduly simplified. The concept of an ""interaction sphere"" is introduced as an attempt to overcome this problem and broaden the perspective of the analysis. After the available ecological and cultural data for the San Juan basin are presented, several hypotheses are advanced and assessed against these data. It is suggested that the widespread distribution of Chacoan traits may have been the result of a standardized cultural response to stress, rather than diffusion from one or two major cultural centers.","April 1, 1978","2014-09-18 18:56:10","2014-09-18 18:56:10","2014-09-18 18:56:10","109-146","","1","34","","Journal of Anthropological Research","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1978 University of New Mexico","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3629633.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent experimental and microscopic research techniques applied to the study of ground stone tools have broadened the recognition of use-wear patterns. Building on the research of tribologists who study wear in order to prevent it, wear mechanisms have been identified that are distinctive to the relative nature of contact between two stone surfaces in addition to the nature of substances worked between contacting surfaces. Tribological wear mechanisms identifiable on stone surfaces include surface fatigue, adhesion, abrasion, and tribochemical interactions, each of which are continuously in play, so that what we see depends on when the wear process was interrupted. Other important factors influencing surface wear are the durability and texture of the rock type selected for tool use.","August 2014","2015-08-05 22:21:15","2015-08-21 17:49:56","2015-08-05 22:21:15","129-138","","","48","","Journal of Archaeological Science","Ground stone use-wear analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313000502/pdfft?md5=27fec3d3048544d45e442cd5128cb6ab&pid=1-s2.0-S0305440313000502-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313000502","","Experiments; Ground stone; Tribology; Use-wear; Wear mechanisms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examples involve quantifying quartz microcrack patterns to analyze stone deterioration, conducting porosimetric studies of stone, examining grain-size distribution and grain shape in stone, comprehensively evaluating deterioration mechanisms of stone, studying conservation treatments of stone, characterizing cementitious materials, analyzing ceramic materials, and measuring layer thickness on a variety of materials. Background issues that must be understood before undertaking or evaluating image analysis include experimental design and statistical validity, calibration, image quality, and image enhancement (preprocessing of images). Early work often required in-house computer programs; recent studies make use of new comprehensive image analysis packages. With the emergence of these packages that provide fast preprocessing and measurement of a wide range parameters, we can expect increasing use of image analysis of petrographic thin sections as an analytical tool in the future. /// Un compte-rendu des recherches dans le domaine de la conservation concernant l'analyse d'images numèriques de plaques minces pètrographiques RÉSUMÉ--Cet article faite le compte-rendu des recherches déjà publiées dans le domaine de la conservation concernant l'analyse d'images numériques de plaques minces pétrographiques. Ces analyses d'images peuvent servir à identifier des réseaux de micro-fissures sur le quartz, ce qui indiquerait une détérioration de la pierre. Elles peuvent aussi permettre des études sur la porosité de la pierre, l'examen de la distribution et de la forme des constituantes de la pierre, l'évaluation des mécanismes de détérioration de la pierre, l'analyse des traitements de restauration de la pierre, la caractérisation des matériaux de cimentation, l'analyse des céramiques, et enfin la mesure de l'épaisseur des couches d'une grande variété de matériaux. Certains principes fondamentaux doivent être compris avant d'évaluer ou d'entreprendre l'analyse d'images numériques, par exemple le design expérimental, la validité statistique, la calibration, la qualité de l'images et l'accentuation d'images (pré-traitement d'image). Au début, l'analyse d'images numérique requérait des programmes informatiques spécifiques, alors que les études récentes utilisent de nouveaux programmes sophisqués, mais courants, d'analyse d'images. Avec I'arrivée d ces nouveaux programmes qui permettent un pré-traitement rapide et facilitent la mesure d'une vaste gamme de paramètres, l'analyse d'images numériques des plaques minces pétrographiques devrait devenir pratique courante dans le futur. /// Reseña del anàlisis de imagen digital de secciones delgadas petrogràficas en la investigación en conservación RESUMEN--Este artículo reseña los trabajos de investigación publicados sobre conservación que utilizan análisis de imagen digital de secciones delgadas petrográficas.

Com o surgimento destes pacotes que proporcionam mais rápidos préprocessamento e medição de uma variedade alargada de parâmetros, pode-se esperar um aumento do uso de imagens digitais das análises petrográficas de camada fina como uma ferramenta analítica no futuro.","July 01, 2006","2012-01-09 01:30:44","2012-01-09 01:30:44","2012-01-09 01:30:44","127-146","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Summer, 2006 / Copyright © 2006 The American Institute for Conservation of Historic & Artistic Works","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/40026492.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting autoradiographs resemble conventional X-radiographs in that they reveal structural details in depth of both the painting and its support. Since the radioactivities arising from the different elements within a painting decay in different manners and at different rates, a series of significantly distinct autoradiographs can be obtained of any painting by making exposures through appropriate filters and at varying times following the original activation. Analysis of such a series of autoradiographs permits the identification of a number of the pigments used in a painting, together with information about the manner in which they were originally laid down by the artist and their distribution throughout the body of the painting. Preliminary investigations have shown that the stability of oil paintings is unaffected by the activation procedure. The inherently necessary radiation dose absorbed by a painting as a result of activation sufficient for autoradiography is of the order of 50 rads. Paintings subjected to absorbed doses one hundred times as great as the dose necessary for autoradiography exhibit no changes in color, hardness, flexibility and solubility three years after their original activation. /// On a constaté qu'une radioactivation non-destructive très modérée de peintures à l'huile, provoquée par un bombardement de neutrons thermiques de façon qu'un seul sur 10<sup>12</sup> atomes d'une peinture quelconque est transformé en une espèce radioactive, produit une radioactivité temporaire qui suffit à exposer une pellicule photographique placée en contact direct avec les peintures. Les autoradiogrammes qui en résultent ressemblent aux radiogrammes ordinaires aux rayons X, en ce sens qu'ils révèlent les détails structurels en profondeur de la peinture elle-même et de son support. Etant donné que les radioactivités surgissant des différents éléments dans une peinture dépérissent de diverses manières et à des rythmes variés, il est possible d'obtenir une série d'autoradiogrammes nettement distincts de n'importe quelle peinture en exposant les pellicules à travers des filtres appropriés et à des époques diverses après l'activation initiale. L'analyse d'une telle série d'autoradiogrammes permet d'identifier un certain nombre de pigments utilisés dans une peinture, ainsi que de constater de quelle façon ils ont été apposés à l'origine par l'artiste et leur distribution à travers le corps de la peinture. Des investigations préliminaires ont révélé que la stabilité de peintures á l'huile n'est pas affectée par le processus d'activation. La dose de radiation nécessairement inhérente qui est absorbée par une peinture en conséquence d'une activation suffisant à un autoradiogramme, se situe dans l'ordre de grandeur de 50 rad. Trois années après leur activation initiale, les peintures assujetties à l'absorption de doses cent fois plus fortes que celle nécessitée pour un autoradiogramme ne manifestent pas de changements dans les coloris, la dureté, la flexibilité et la solubilité. /// Eine schwache, unschädliche Aktivierung von Ölgemälden, durch Beschuß mit thermischen Neutronen--so, daß nur etwa eines von 10<sup>12</sup> Atomen in eine radioaktive Form umgewandelt wird--erzeugt eine temporäre Radioaktivität, die ausreicht um einen photographischen Film, der sich in unmittelbarem Kontakt mit dem Gemälde befindet, zu belichten. Die dabei entstehenden Auto-Radiogramme sind den üblichen Röntgenaufnahmen insoweit ähnlich, daß sie strukturelle Einzelheiten in der Tiefe der Malerei und des Bildträgers erkennen lassen. Da die Radioaktivitäten, die aus den verschiedenen, in einem Gemälde enthaltenen Elementen entstehen, verschiedenartig und mit verschiedener Geschwindigkeit abklingen, kann man eine Reihe deutlich unterscheidbarer Auto-Radiogramme von einem Gemälde erhalten, indem man die Belichtung durch geeignete Filter und in verschiedenem zeitlichen Abstand von der ursprünglichen Aktivierung vornimmt. Die Analyse einer solchen Serie von Aufnahmen erlaubt die Identifizierung einer Anzahl von Pigmenten, die in dem Gemälde verwendet worden sind, und gibt gleichzeitig Auskunft über die Art und Weise, wie diese vom Maler aufgetragen worden sind, und über deren Verteilung in der Farbmasse des Gemäldes. Vorläufige Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, daß die Haltbarkeit von Ölgemalden durch den Aktivierungsprozeß nicht beeinträchtigt wird. Die unbedingt notwendige Strahlendosis, die von einem Gemälde absorbiert wird, um eine für Auto-Radiogramme ausreichende Aktivierung zu gewährleisten, liegt in der Größenordnung von 50 rad. Gemälde, die einer 100 fach größeren Dosis als für Auto-Radiographie notwendig ist, ausgesetzt waren, zeigen 3 Jahre nach ihrer Aktivierung keinerlei Veränderung in der Farbe, Härte, Biegsamkeit und Löslichkeit. /// Un'assai moderata radioattivazione indistruttiva di pitture ad olio indotta a mezzo di bombardamento di neutroni termica, sicché approssimativamente solo uno in 10<sup>12</sup> degli atomi compresi in ciascuna pittura viene trasformato in specie radioattive, è stata scoperta per produrre radioattività sufficiente per esporre dei films fotografici messi a diretto contatto con le pitture. Le autoradiografie ottenute assomigliano a radiografie X convenzionali in quanto esse rivelano dettagli strutturali in profondità di entrambe le pitture e loro supporti. Dall'emanazione delle radioattività dei vari elementi di decomposizione delle pitture in diversi modi ed in tempo diverso, si può ottenere una serie di autoradiografie significativamente distinte di ogni pittura, facendo delle esposizioni per mezzo di appositi filtri e, al cambiare del tempo, seguendo l'attivazione originale. Analisi di tali serie di autoradiografie permettono l'identificazione di un numero di pigmenti usati in una pittura unitamente all'informazione circa la maniera con la quale venne originariamente dipinto dall'artista e la sua distribuzione attraverso il corpo della pittura. Ricerche preliminari hanno dimostrato che la stabilità delle pitture ad olio non è affettata nel procedimento di attivazione. La dose di radiazione assolutamente necessaria da assorbire dalla pittura per un risultato di attivazione sufficiente per autoradiografia è nell'ordine di 50 rad. Pitture soggette all'assorbimento di dosi 100 volte maggiori della dose necessaria per autoradiografia, non cambiano colore, durezza, flessibilità e solubilità per la durata di 3 anni dopo la loro attivazione originale. /// Una radioactivación no destructiva y muy moderada de pinturas al oleo, inducida por bombardeo neutrón térmico, de manera que sólo uno en 10<sup>12</sup> de los átomos que contiene cualquier pintura, se transforme en una especie radioactiva, ha sido demonstrada a producir temporadamente una radioactividad suficiente para exponer película fotográfica, puesta en contacto directo con las pinturas. Las autoradiografías que resultan, parecen X-radiografías convencionales en el sentido que revelan detalles estructurales en profundidad tanto de la pintura como de su sustento. Como las radioactividades, proveniendo de los varios elementos dentro de una pintura descaecen de formas diferentes y en proporciones diferentes, puede obtenerse una serie de autoradiografías expresivamente distintas de cualquier pintura, haciendo exposiciones a través de los filtros apropiados y a momentos variables después de la activación original. El análisis de tal serie de autoradiografías permite la identificación de un número de pigmentos, usados en una pintura junto con información sobre la forma en que originalmente fueron metidos por el artista y su distribución por todo el cuerpo de la pintura. Investigaciones preliminarias han demostrado que la estabilidad de pinturas al óleo no es afectada por el procedimiento de la activación. La dosís de radiación inherentamente necesaria, absorbida por una pintura resultando de una activación suficiente para autoradiografía es de la orden de 50 rad. Pinturas sometidas a dosís absorbidas, que eran cien veces más grandes que la dosís necesaria para autoradiografía, no muestran cambios en color, solidez, flexibilidad y solubilidad a los tres años después su activación original.","November 1, 1968","2013-05-19 15:39:43","2013-05-19 15:39:43","2013-05-19 15:39:43","161-185","","4","13","","Studies in Conservation","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1968 International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Nov., 1968 / Copyright © 1968 International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/1505428.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, the amount of paste variability has been seen as an indicator of different types of production organization. Ethnoarchaeological data from Mexico, Peru, and Guatemala suggest that a variety of environmental, technological, and social factors influence paste variability. These factors are important in all production contexts and complicate inferences drawn about production organization in antiquity. As a consequence, social and economic inferences derived from ancient ceramic pastes need to be understood in relation to numerous other factors such as natural variability of the ceramic raw materials, their procurement, and their use in paste preparation. Furthermore, changes in resource use and paste preparation over time can obscure intracommunity and other fine-scale patterns. As a consequence, it is argued that little, if anything, can be learned about the organization of production below the level of the local production community. Rather, the primary usefulness of paste compositional analyses lies in the identification, in geographic and geological spaces (“community signature units”), of source communities that exploit raw materials within a limited range of probably no more than 3 to 4 km. Paste analyses thus provide important information about the organization of ceramic distribution, revealing the emergence and demise of source communities and the movement of their ceramic products.","2000/12/01","2013-11-02 16:49:44","2013-11-02 16:49:44","2013-11-02 16:49:44","333-375","","4","7","","Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu","","","","; ","http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1026570906712.pdf; http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1026570906712","clay processing; not read; technological style","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FRPF4VHN","journalArticle","2011","Bamforth, Douglas B.","ORIGIN STORIES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, AND POSTCLOVIS PALEOINDIAN BISON HUNTING ON THE GREAT PLAINS","American Antiquity","","0002-7316","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/41331873","Reconstructions of the Paleoindian period are archaeology's origin stories about the native people of North America. These reconstructions have strongly emphasized great differences between recent and ancient Native Americans, echoing a perspective with its roots in the nineteenth century. One central component of the differences archaeologists have seen lies in the way that Paleoindian groups moved across the landscape. Particularly on the Great Plains, these movements have been seen as unpredictable and nonrepetitive, with this view founded largely in interpretations of evidence from large bison kills. This paper compares the overall patterns of post-Clovis Paleoindian and post-Paleoindian communal bison hunting on the Plains, arguing that there is no evidence of rapid or substantial change in such hunting at the end of the Paleoindian period. Although hunting practices did not remain exactly the same over time, most of the basic characteristics of Paleoindian hunting were common on the Plains for millennia. Only the northern Plains stands out from this, and it does so only within the last 2,000 to 3,000 years, probably in reaction to the development of continent-wide exchange networks. Paleoindians certainly lived different lives than did later occupants of the Great Plains, but the literature significantly exaggerates the magnitude of this difference. Las reconstrucciones del Periodo Paleoindio pueden considerarse como las historias que la arqueología narra en torno al origen de los pueblos nativos de Norteamérica. Estas reconstrucciones han pue sto énfasis en una fuerte diferencia entre los Nativos Americanos recientes con aquellos de la antigüedad, haciendo eco de una perspectiva que tiene sus raíces en el sigio XIX. Un componente central de las diferencias que los arqueólogos han visto, radica en la manera en que los grupos Paleoindios se movían a través del paisaje, particularmente en el caso de las Grandes Planícies, tales movimientos se hanpercibido como impredecibles y no repetitivos. Esta vision se fundamente principalmente en las interpretaciones que se hacen de las grandes matanzas de bisontes. Este artículo compara los patrones generales de las cacerías comunales de bisontes llevadas a cabo por grupos Paleoindios post-Clovis así como por post-Paleoindios. Se argumenta que no hay evidencia de un cambio rápido en lasprácticas de cacería comunal a finales del Periodo Paleoindio. Aunque lasprácticas de cacería no permanecieron exactamente iguales a lo largo del tiempo, la mayoría de las características básicas de la cacería Peleoindia persistieron en las Grandes Planícies por milénios. Unicamente las Planícies del norte rompen esta práctica, y esto sucede en los últimos 2000 a 3000 años, probablemente como una reacción al desarrollo de amplias redes de intercambio continentales. Los Paleoindios ciertamente tuvieron formas distintas de vida de que las que tuvieron los ocupantes más tardios de las Grandes Planícies, pero la bibliografía actual exagera significantemente la magnitud de estas diferencias.","January 1, 2011","2015-09-11 14:04:54","2015-09-11 14:04:54","2015-09-11 14:04:54","24-40","","1","76","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2011 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/S59N4I86/Bamforth - 2011 - ORIGIN STORIES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, AND POSTC.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we compare various measurements of manos (e.g., grinding surface area), macrobotanical evidence of maize use, and human collagen stable carbon isotope values from six regions of the American Southwest, encompassing 16 phases, as a means of assessing the power and limits of each approach for considering agricultural dependence. The analysis of each data class is considered separately, taking into account formation processes and arguments linking data and inferences. Correlations among the three data classes suggest that mano area and maize ubiquity can be considered ordinal measures of agricultural dependence, but Southwestern stable carbon isotope data have the analytical potential only to discriminate between little or no maize use and substantial maize use. The formation processes and linking arguments associated with each method must be considered when multiple lines of evidence are integrated in order to make sound behavioral inferences. Our results suggest that there were at least three patterns in the adoption of farming in the Southwest: early substantial use followed by continuous increasing maize dependence, initial intensive dependence with little change in later periods, and a long period of minor use followed by substantial dependence.","1996","2011-01-16 22:42:38","2011-01-16 22:42:38","2011-01-16 22:42:38","253-318","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Sep., 1996 / Copyright © 1996 Springer","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/20177349.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Annual banding, hiatuses, and high-precision uranium-series dating show a present day-like climate from 4000 to 3000 years ago, following a drier middle Holocene. A distinctly wetter and cooler period from 3000 to 800 years ago was followed by a period of present day-like conditions, with the exception of a slightly wetter interval from 440 to 290 years before the present. The stalagmite record correlates well with the archaeological record of changes in cultural activities of indigenous people. Such climate change may help to explain evidence of dwelling abandonment and population redistribution.","October 5, 2001","2015-08-28 13:43:09","2015-08-28 13:43:09","2015-08-28 13:43:09","148-151","","5540","294","","Science","","New Series","","","","","","","Copyright © 2001 American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/N7W6V3UK/Polyak and Asmerom - 2001 - Late Holocene Climate and Cultural Changes in the .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less attention has been paid to the role of the abundant, European-produced goods that are also found in the homes of enslaved families. The material culture from one enslaved Bahamian family is explored here, looking at how European-produced goods were selected by enslaved Africans and imbued with meanings in the creation of a Creole culture. The family discussed lived on Clifton plantation, on the island of New Providence, and consisted of an African-born couple and their two island-born children. The enslaved population, due to the paternalistic attitudes of the plantation owner, enjoyed an unusual degree of access to island markets. Using analyses of ceramics and pipes recovered from the household, it is argued that African-based aesthetics directed the selection and composition of the artifacts recovered from the dwelling.","2000","2011-01-24 15:39:31","2012-11-15 02:33:53","2011-01-24 15:39:31","10-26","","3","34","","","Culture Bought","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Evidence of Creolization in the Consumer Goods of an Enslaved Bahamiam Family / Full publication date: 2000 / Copyright © 2000 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616828.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fuzzy clustering is a more modern technique than methods normally used by archaeologists and has not been much exploited. Applications that have been reported are sometimes unsatisfactory and usually do not exploit the ‘fuzziness’ of the procedure. After a brief review of the more common methods of cluster analysis, fuzzy ideas and fuzzy clustering are discussed. The method is applied to three data sets of different sizes and complexity, to illustrate particular aspects of, and problems in, application. Summarizing results is less easy than for more standard methods, but has the potential to reveal features of the data concealed by other methods.","2009","2013-04-11 18:21:39","2013-04-11 18:21:39","2013-04-11 18:21:39","1035–1054","","6","51","","","","","","","","","","en","© University of Oxford, 2009","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.unm.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00449.x/abstract","","CLUSTER ANALYSIS; FUZZY; LATE ROMAN COOKING WARES; R; ROMANO-BRITISH GLASS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guevavi, first established by Father Eusebio Kino at a populous Piman village in 1691, was to be the first and principal mission of Spain's northern frontier in what is now Arizona. Beginning in 1701 tenacious Jesuit and later Franciscan missionaries attempted to establish permanent residency at the village. But the cumulative effects of Apache raids, food shortages, Piman revolts, and epidemics eventually forced the complete abandonment of Guevavi in 1773. Remnants of the final mission church (San Miguel de Guevavi), built in 1751, still stand in spite of two centuries of both benign neglect and extensive vandalism. The site is in the process of being acquired by the National Park Service as a part of Tumacacori National Historical Park. Prior to stabilization of the church walls, limited excavations were conducted during May and June of 1991 by archeologists from the Western Archeological and Conservation Center. These excavations exposed details of the massive adobe architecture and measured the extent of disturbance at the church. Analysis of the material remains recovered provide a glimpse of life on the frontier of New Spain.","1992","2015-08-28 14:53:32","2015-08-28 14:53:32","","","","","","","","San Miguel de Guevavi","Publications in Anthropology","57","","","Western Archeological and Conservation Center","Tucson, Arizona","en","","","","Tumacacori National Historical Park, Western Archeological and Conservation Center","core.tdar.org","","","","","","","Guevavi; Historic; Historic Native American; Spanish","","","","Benitez, Alex V.; Clark, Mertla J.; D'Ascenzo, Lynne M.; Fish, Suzanne K.; Gillespie, William B.; Huckell, Lisa W.; Robinson, William J.; Sheppard, John C.; Teague, George A.; Underwood, Sali A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although potters in each locale decorated and used pots in virtually identical fashion, they tempered clays and formed vessels in appreciably different ways. Situated learning theory offers a framework for interpreting these divergent trends in early pottery by focusing attention on the multiple communities of practice in which potters participated. Independent data on the handedness of potters supports the inference that techniques for making pottery were transmitted cognately, whereas decorative expression and methods of cooking crosscut residential units as a result of affinal relations. Potential contradictions arising from different types and changing forms of community membership may have contributed to radical changes in pottery technology and decoration after some fifteen generations of relative stability.","December 1, 2001","2013-05-24 01:59:39","2013-05-24 01:59:39","2013-05-24 01:59:39","407-425","","4","57","","Journal of Anthropological Research","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2001 University of New Mexico","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Learning and Craft Production / Full publication date: Winter, 2001 / Copyright © 2001 University of New Mexico","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/3631353.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"GU6ID3GS","report","2006","Kurota, Alexander; Actis, Adrienne T; Melsheimer, Rebecca; Stauber, Ronald L; Lasusky, Donna K; Hogan, Patrick","Archeological survey and testing for proposed Hatch dam and flood pool construction, Doña Ana County, New Mexico","","","","","","This report presents the results of an archeological survey the University of New Mexico's Office of Contract Archeology (OCA/UNM) within the town limits of Hatch, New Mexico.  The project was conducted at the request of Mr. Jorge R. Colberg of the United States Army Corps of Engineers office in Albuquerque to perform a Class III survey of roughly 70 acres of land proposed for a flood control dam construction with a resulting flood pool in Hatch, Dona Ana county, New Mexico.  The planned project involves building an earthen dam whose outlet will feed into the existing Colorado Spur Drain.  In addition, the project will also involve the removal of an existing spoil bank levee along an arroyo that will feed into the pool.  The survey area, therefore, included the proposed flood control dam and the resulting flood-pool.  The project area is a state-owned parcel located in the northwestern quarter of Section 16, Township 19 South, Range 3 West, of Hatch USGS 7.5' quadrangle (1959).  OCA archeologists performed the fieldwork between April 24 and 28, 2006.  Four new sites, two previously documented canals and nine isolated occurrences were documented during this undertaking.  Two sites were also tested for buried cultural deposits.  The results of the fieldwork suggest that none of the four new sites are eligible for the inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

However, in archaeology such statements are found to be implicit, untested, and extremely general in referent. We further argue that the testing of potential laws requires a shift from an inductive procedure, or from one in which undirected data collection forms the first and the ""abstraction"" of laws from data forms the last research step, to a deductive procedure in which the explicit formulation of potential laws and their empirical consequences precedes and directs the collection of data.","October 1, 1970","2015-10-07 14:40:57","2015-10-07 14:40:57","2015-10-07 14:40:57","405-412","","4","35","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1970 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/278113.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many of the key parameters are well understood, several questions require further analysis. These include the radiographic distinction between wheel-thrown and wheel-shaped pots and an assessment of the impact of secondary forming techniques and surface treatments on inclusion orientation laid down during primary forming. To clarify these issues, controlled experiments were conducted. Results indicate that coiled and wheel-shaped vessels can be distinguished radiographically from fully wheel-thrown ones. As regards secondary forming and surface treatments, none of those investigated could be shown to obscure traces of primary forming techniques. Overall, X-radiography is shown to be a valuable tool for understanding forming techniques and sequences of ancient vessels. Assessing X-radiography's contribution in characterising clay fabrics, experiments were conducted with regard to clay body and inclusion visibility. These experiments support Foster's conclusions [Foster. G.V., 1985. Identification of inclusions in ceramic artefacts by xeroradiography.

This cartographic product was obtained using a combination of accurate field surveys together with airborne Lidar analysis, aerial photo interpretation and thermographic field surveys within a GIS. The map was prepared in order to analyze the morphological features of the landslide and therefore improve interpretation of the GB-InSAR data. This monitoring device was installed on the site after the detachment of a debris mass of 225,000 m3 on 4 November 2010. The main purpose of the post-event activities, including the geomorphological characterization, was to detect the processes acting on the landslide, evaluate the hazard related to each phenomenon, understand the landslide kinematics and define the residual risk for the area.The geomorphological map suggests that debris production and detachment are hazardous phenomena that involve the surficial detrital cover of a bigger and more complex landslide. The latter has the typical characteristics of a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation. The distinction between secondary processes, which appear to be the most hazardous in the short-term, and deep seated ones, demonstrates that accurate mapping provides important information for local administrations and decision makers, allowing them to prepare landslide susceptibility and hazard models.","July 3, 2014","2015-09-29 18:51:34","2015-09-29 18:51:34","2015-09-29 18:51:34","394-401","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","; ","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17445647.2013.869666; http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17445647.2013.869666","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach is demonstrated through an analysis of the distribution of one-hand manos, two-hand manos, and trough metates at Anasazi sites in southwestern Colorado.","July 01, 1991","2011-04-27 11:52:27","2011-04-27 11:52:27","2011-04-27 11:52:27","460-474","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jul., 1991 / Copyright © 1991 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/280895.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of 63 of the ceramics provides baseline data for documenting the growth and spread of Spanish majolica industries and networks of supply during the Spanish colonial period. In an initial comparison the kiln site data are shown to match majolica data from the North African Portuguese fort of Qsar es-Seghir (1458-1550) and the New World Spanish mission of Santa Catalina de Guale (1567-1680), confirming that Seville majolica was exported to both settlements. The Santa Catalina samples are from more than one source, however, and some are compositionally unrelated to any Spanish data. Two alternative hypotheses are offered to explain the difference in supply at the two colonies.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-24 15:29:14","2011-01-24 15:29:14","2011-01-24 15:29:14","131-147","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: The Archaeology of the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republican Periods / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616149.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present data from two relatively unknown Clovis projectile point assemblages from this region: the first is from the Mockingbird Gap Clovis site and the second is from a survey of the surrounding region. Our goals are to reconstruct general features of the paleoecological adaptation of Clovis populations in the region using raw material sourcing and then to compare the point technology in the region to other Clovis assemblages in. the Southwest and across the continent. Our results show that both assemblages were manufactured from similar suites of raw materials that come almost exclusively from the central Rio Grande rift region and the adjacent mountains of New Mexico. Additionally, we show that Clovis projectile points in the study region are significantly smaller than the continental average. Our results suggest that Clovis populations in this region operated within a large, well-known, and relatively high-elevation territory encompassing much of northern and western New Mexico.","APR 2013","2015-10-16 15:40:35","2015-10-16 15:40:35","","248-265","","2","78","","Am.

Unfortunately, sampling errors can arise at several steps in the CMR process. We designed and applied a mobile application (app) for field-collected data from a CMR study on herpetofauna. Entering data into a digital format in the field using the mobile application eliminated timely steps to process handwritten data sheets and double-checking data entries. Applications were developed for mobile devices on the iOS and Android operating systems. Both platforms have similar user interactions via data entry on a touch screen using pre-programmed fields, checkboxes, drop-down menus, and keypad entry. Our mobile application includes features to insure collection of all measurements in the field through pop-up messages and can proof entries for valid formats. The application can assign unique numbers to newly captured individuals by querying the database for unused codes and eliminates the potential to assign 2 individuals with the same unique code. Technicians can query a database to view histories of previously captured animals from the field. During a 2-month project, we estimated that using the mobile application instead of manual data entry and proofing via data sheets reduced our total project time by 10%. To our knowledge, this is the first application developed for mobile devices for biologists using CMR techniques and could be developed for use in other areas of field data collection. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","December 1, 2013","2014-10-09 18:57:51","2015-08-21 18:18:05","2014-10-09 18:57:51","838-845","","4","37","","Wildl.

This period of abandonment has been conventionally understood as a consequence of population decline. An examination of archaeological settlement patterns in two areas of the Rio Grande region of New Mexico, the Jemez Plateau and the Rio Abajo, during the period A.D. 1515-1700 reveals occupation at many more sites than those identified in historic documents. The patterns of settlement indicate the maintenance of long-standing mobility practices on the Jemez Plateau. In the Rio Abajo, there are significant population shifts as a consequence of movement to communities outside of the area, and from large to small settlements. These settlement changes during the first centuries of colonial rule demonstrate the use of established Pueblo settlement and mobility practices to respond to the new challenges of Spanish domination. They also indicate that abandonment during the early historic era cannot be automatically equated with population decline. /// La colonización hispánica de la parte norte del sudoeste en el siglo diecisiete coincidió con el abandono masivo de grandes poblados. Convencionalmente, el periodo de abandono ha sido entendido como consecuencia de un descenso en la población. Un examen de los patrones arqueológicos de asentamiento en dos áreas de la región del Río Grande en Nuevo México, la Meseta Jemez y el Río Abajo durante el periodo que va del año 1515 al año 1700 d. C. revela que hubo ocupaciones en muchos más sitios que aquellos que hasta ahora han sido identificados en documentos históricos. Estos patrones de asentamiento indican un mantenimiento de prácticas antiguas de movilidad en la Meseta Jemez. En el Río Abajo hay cambios significativos de población como consecuencia del desplazamiento a comunidades fuera del área, y de asentamientos grandes a asentamientos pequeños. Estos cambios de asentamiento durante los primeros siglos de la colonia demuestran el recurso del establecimiento en poblados y de las prácticas de movilidad para responder a los nuevos retos del dominio español. Asimismo, indican que el abandono durante la era histórica temprana no puede ser automáticamente ligada con un descenso de población.","October 1, 2003","2015-09-10 16:51:35","2015-09-10 16:51:35","2015-09-10 16:51:35","30-54","","1","69","","Kiva","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2003 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/30246436.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early northern Anasazi villages probably practiced patterns of resource control much like those documented historically in many pueblos, where agricultural lands were frequently controlled at an atomistic level (by individuals or households) so long as fields were in use, but remained communal property in theory and could be reallocated to other members of the community. The appearance of field houses may be an attempt to limit access to previously free and unregulated lands and the resources thereon in response to resource scarcity. This scarcity, in turn, may be the result of overexploitation of such lands, in part through shifting cultivation. The general process of overexploitation of commons leading either to their centralized regulation or to privatization has been described by Hardin (1968) as the ""tragedy of the commons.""","October 1, 1992","2015-09-10 20:14:12","2015-09-10 20:14:12","2015-09-10 20:14:12","617-635","","4","57","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1992 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/280826.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the type site for the Pine Lawn phase, conventionally dated at ca. A.C. 200 to 550, the SU site has been assumed to represent evidence for a cultural continuum between the preceramic and ceramic horizons in this region. This study presents information indicating that although a preceramic occupation is present at the SU site, stratigraphic and chronological data supporting a cultural continuum from the preceramic are ambiguous. In addition, chronological data from the SU site and other local early ceramic period sites do not indicate pottery use until about A.C. 450 or later, suggesting that the beginning of ceramic manufacture in the rugged highland portions of the Mogollon cultural area occurred later than in most other areas of the American Southwest. In addition, other new data help refine current models for the emergence of sedentary villages in this region.","October 1, 1996","2015-09-16 13:59:33","2015-09-16 13:59:33","2015-09-16 13:59:33","335-359","","3","23","","Journal of Field Archaeology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1996 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/4PBD7S57/Wills - 1996 - The Transition from the Preceramic to Ceramic Peri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, such understanding is generally lacking because the methods used to document occupational histories of settlements tend to either obscure fine-grained temporal distinctions or necessitate costly, and politically objectionable, large-scale excavations. To overcome these difficulties, we use surface expressions to analyze the occupational and population history of San Marcos Pueblo (LA98), an aggregated, late prehistoric site in the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico that persisted to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Field methods include detailed mapping of the settlement and systematic surface collections of middens. Frequency seriation, correspondence analysis, and mean ceramic dates of decorated ceramic rims comprise our principal analytic methods and demonstrate that the pueblo was abandoned four times before 1680. Causes of abandonment are discussed. Relative scale measures of population show demographic fluctuations with maximum aggregation during the fifteenth century. Despite demographic pulses, the pueblo remained vital until the terminal abandonment. /// Para entender los efectos del contacto europeo en la organización, el tamaño y la movilidad de los poblaciónes amerindias ""Pueblo"" en el suroeste de los Estados Unidos de América, se necesita un conocimiento detallado de las historias de ocupación de los poblados de agregación que caracterizan los registros tardi prehistórico y histórico temprano. Desgraciadamente, tal conocimiento falta generalmente porque los métodos empleados para documentar las historias de la ocupación los yacimientos tienden o a obscurecer las distincciones temporales finas o requieren excavaciónes grandes y costosas o políticamente dificiles. Para superar estas dificultades, empleamos las evidencias en surperficie para analizar la historia de ocupación y de población del Pueblo de San Marcos (LA 98), un gran poblado de agregación tardi- prehistorica en la Cuenca de Galisteo de Nuevo Mexico que continuó hasta la Revuelta de los Indios Pueblo en 1680. Los métodos del trabajo de campo incluyeron la cartografiá detallada del yacimiento y la recogida sistemática de colecciones de superficie en las zonas de basurero. La seriación de frecuencias, el análisis de correspondencia y los promedios de las fechas ceramicas de los bordes decoradas componen nuestros métodos analíticos principales y demuestran que el pueblo fué abandonados cuatro veces antes de 1680. Se discuten las causas del abandono. Las medidas del tamaño relativo de la población demuestran la existencia de fluctuaciones demográficas, con una máxima agregación durante el siglo XV. A pesar de las pulsaciones demográficas, el pueblo seguió siendo vital hasta su abandono final.","July 1, 2009","2015-10-13 22:07:41","2015-10-13 22:07:41","2015-10-13 22:07:41","505-530","","3","74","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2009 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imagery on the south portal of the cathedral of Santiago conveyed messages of ecclesiastical authority to specific audiences, namely the cathedral chapter and inhabitants of the town. The unseverable link between the cathedral of Santiago and pilgrimage, however, has caused scholars to overlook the importance of the local population as an audience for the cult of St. James and the art patronage program of the cathedral's bishop, Diego Gelmírez (1100-1140). This paper will explore the reception of the iconography of the cathedral's south portal by various audiences in the twelfth century. The cathedral canons and townspeople may have responded to the imagery in a manner diametrically opposed to the prescribed reading of this sculptural ensemble commissioned by the bishop. The audiences' multiple readings, mis-readings, and non-readings of the south portal imagery demonstrate the indeterminacy inherent in the iconography of Romanesque sculpture and highlight the importance of the dialectical relationship between production and reception to its understanding.","January 01, 2000","2011-01-16 20:25:06","2011-01-16 20:25:06","2011-01-16 20:25:06","3-12","","1","39","","","Reading Romanesque Sculpture","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: 2000 / Copyright © 2000 International Center of Medieval Art","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/767148.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multidisciplinary approach is taken in which perspectives from different disciplines (especially archaeology and comparative linguistics in this instance) are used for what L. Fogelin recently called “inference to the best explanation.” It is suggested that once food production was firmly established in noncircumscribed circumstances in many parts of the world, with transportable domesticated crops and animals, human population dispersals would have occurred. These dispersals reorganized a great deal of human diversity in language and biology, especially in the Neolithic or Formative phases of regional prehistory.","October 1, 2009","2015-08-28 12:38:29","2015-08-28 12:38:29","2015-08-28 12:38:29","621-626","","5","50","","Current Anthropology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2009 The University of Chicago Press","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/VA6JQ987/Bellwood - 2009 - The Dispersals of Established Food‐Producing Popul.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These technological improvements included morphological changes that allowed for more efficient use of the tools, increased time spent at the grinding task (grinding intensity), and the management of tool wear. Ethnographic references and experiments provide a background for comparing the technological advantages and disadvantages of basin, trough, and flat mano-metate sets. Technological improvements allow individual food grinders to solve the problems created by changing social requirements for flour. Thus, morphological variation in manos and metates has behavioral and social implications. /// Este artículo explora como manos y metates, utilizados como juego para machacar comida, se modificaron como resultado de adelantos tecnoldgicos. Estos avances incluyeron campios en la morfología que permitieron el uso mas efectivo de las herramientas; incrementando así, el tiempo efectivo usado en la actividad de molienda (intensidad de molienda) y el mejor manejo del implemento. Las referencias etnográficas y los experimentos han proveido una base para comparar las ventajas y desventajas tecnológicas entre metates en forma de palangana, metates cóncavos de paredes rectas y juegos de manos y metates planos. Estos avances tecnológicos permitieron a moledores particulares resolver los problemas creados al modificarse la necesidad social por harina. En consecuencia, las variaciones morfológicas en manos y metaste tuvieron implicaciones tanto de conducta como sociales.","January 01, 1993","2011-05-10 03:26:19","2011-05-10 03:26:19","2011-05-10 03:26:19","331-344","","3","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: New Trends in Ground Stone Research: It's Not the Same Old Grind / Full publication date: 1993 / Copyright © 1993 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/30247403.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The samples selected are representative of the earliest known lustre productions. The data obtained from the study of the medieval samples are compared to laboratory reproductions and gives important clues about the invention, perfection and success of lustre during this period. The change from polychrome to monochrome lustre decorations and the increase in the lead content of the glazes are the key parameters in the success of obtaining a golden lustre.","May 2008","2011-01-16 22:32:42","2011-01-16 22:32:42","2011-01-16 22:32:42","1201-1215","","5","35","","","The invention of lustre","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6WH8-4PXG7P8-1-D&_cdi=6844&_user=1550512&_pii=S0305440307001665&_origin=search&_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2008&_sk=999649994&view=c&wchp=dGLbVlW-zSkWA&md5=7ae059df6407762c235e043b9cba284d&ie=/sdarticle.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WH8-4PXG7P8-1&_user=1550512&_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2008&_alid=1608955742&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_zone=rslt_list_item&_cdi=6844&_sort=r&_st=13&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=1&_acct=C000053660&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=1550512&md5=c9d4ee81d2058f45637587ac1e7bd1f7&searchtype=a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By the 19th century the range of wares available was greatly reduced due to the success of the English ceramic industry which displaced many fine ware types such as white salt glazed stoneware and tin-glazed earthenware. The major type available in the 19th century was English white earthenware which included creamware, pearlware, whiteware, and the stone chinas. By the 19th century classification of these wares by potters, merchants, and people who used them was by how they were decorated (i.e., painted, edged, dipped, printed etc.) rather than the ware types as defined by archaeologists. Using a classification based on decoration will achieve two things: an ability to integrate archaeological data with historical data and establishment of a more consistent classification system than is now possible using ware types. The second part of this paper generates a set of index values from price lists, bills of lading, and account books which can be used to study the expenditures made on cups, plates, and bowls from archaeological assemblages from the first half of the 19th century. Expenditure patterns from five sites are discussed.","January 1, 1980","2014-07-01 20:08:12","2014-07-01 20:08:12","2014-07-01 20:08:12","1-40","","","14","","Historical Archaeology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1980 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/25615367.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vance, Jr.","The Ventana Complex: New Dates and New Ideas on Its Place in Early Holocene Western Prehistory","American Antiquity","","0002-7316","10.2307/3557084","http://www.jstor.org/stable/3557084","Radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples and a re-examination of the artifacts from the Volcanic Debris layer in Ventana Cave were conducted in 1992-1994. The goal of this research was to better understand the chronological position and cultural affinities of the Ventana Complex, the name applied to the assemblage recovered from the Volcanic Debris. Ten new Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14C ages suggest that the Volcanic Debris accumulated between approximately 8800 B.P. and 10,500 B.P., and the lack of stratigraphic ordering of the dates indicates that the Volcanic Debris was subjected to considerable turbation as it accumulated. This turbation may have led to the incorporation of bones of extinct fauna from an underlying conglomerate deposit rich in horse remains, creating the impression of their association with artifacts. The artifacts are probably the product of episodic, special-purpose occupations spanning centuries or millennia. Technological and morphological studies of the stone tools indicate few similarities with classic Paleoindian industries, and greater similarities to early Holocene Archaic occupations in the Great Basin and Southwest. Correlations of the Ventana Cave stratigraphy with that of southeastern Arizona and with the late Pleistocene and Holocene record of Northern Hemisphere climate are explored. /// Durante los años 1992-1994 se fecharon muestras radio carbónicas y se reevaluaron los artefactos que pertenecen a la capa Escombros Volcánicos (Volcanic Debris) de la Cueva de la Ventana. El objetivo de este estudio era comprender mejor la posición cronológica y las relaciones culturales del Complejo Ventana, nombre que se aplica a la colección de artefactos recuperados en esta capa. Diez nuevas fechas radio carbónicas (AMS) indican que la capa Escombros Volcánicos se acumuló entre aproximadamente 8,800 y 10,500 A.P, y la falta de orden estratigráfico en las fechas nos indica que la capa Escombros Volcánicos estuvo sujeto a perturbaciones considerables mientras se fue acumulando. Estas perturbaciones habrían incorporado restos de fauna extinguida, que pudieran haber sido acarreados de depósitos subyacentes que contienen abundantes restos equinos. Estos hechos han creado la impresión de que los restos óseos están asociados con los artefactos culturales. Estos son probablemente el resultado de ocupaciones episódicas y de ocupaciones confines muy específicos que continuaban por siglos o milenios. Los estudios tecnológicos y morfológicos de herramientas líticas muestran muy pocas características en común con aquellas de las industrias clásicas de los Paleoindios. En cambio tienen más en común con las ocupaciones Arcaicas tempranas de la época Holoceno en la Great Basin y el Suroeste. En esta investigación, se desarrollan las correlaciones estratigráficas de la Cueva de la Ventana con el sureste de Arizona, tanto como con el registro del clima del hemisferio norte durantes las épocas de Pleistoceno tardío y Holoceno.","April 1, 2003","2015-09-03 15:37:25","2015-09-03 15:37:25","2015-09-03 15:37:25","353-371","","2","68","","American Antiquity","The Ventana Complex","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2003 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/MMKQISEU/Huckell and Haynes - 2003 - The Ventana Complex New Dates and New Ideas on It.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This readable book demonstrates that northern New Mexico's twentieth-century Spanish heritage owes as much to the coming of the Santa Fe Railroad in 1880 as to the first Spanish colonial campaign of 1598. As the railroad brought capital and migrants into the region, Anglos posed an unprecedented challenge to Hispano wealth and political power. Yet unlike their counterparts in California and Texas, the Anglo newcomers could not wholly displace their Spanish-speaking rivals. Nor could they segregate themselves or the upper Rio Grande from the image, well-known throughout the Southwest, of the disreputable Mexican. Instead, prominent Anglos and Hispanos found common cause in transcending the region's Mexican character. Turning to colonial symbols of the conquistador, the Franciscan missionary, and the humble Spanish settler, they recast northern New Mexico and its people.

These excavations revealed a deeply buried San Pedro phase component with radiocarbon dates ranging from 2700-3100 B.P. The site contains a pit structure, storage pits, and thermal pits that apparently represent long-term reoccupation of the floodplain. The Early Agricultural period occupants of the site practiced a mixed subsistence strategy of hunting, gathering, and farming, and were beginning to incorporate ceramic technology into their artifact assemblage. Data from the Valley Farms site thus expand our understanding of the earliest agricultural occupation of the Tucson Basin. /// Este documento resume los resultados de recientes excavaciones en el Sitio Valley Farms, AZ AA:12:736 en la parte norte de la Cuenca de Tucsón. Estas excavaciones revelaron elementos de la fase San Pedro profundamente enterrados. La antigüedad de dichos elementos, determinada mediante radiocarbón, se encuentran entre 2700 y 3100 B.P. El sitio contiene estructuras de fosas, así como fosas para almacenamiento y fosas donde manejaban fuego para cocinar o construir herramientas. Dichas estructuras aparentemente muestran ocupaciones recurrentes de largo plazo del plano de inundaciones. Los ocupantes del sitio en el periodo agrícola temprano practicaban una estrategia mixta de caza, recolección y cultivo; y comenzaron a incorporar tecnología de cerámica al ensamblar sus artefactos. Datos provenientes del sitio Valley Farms amplían nuestra comprensión de la primera ocupación agrícola de la Cuenca de Tucsón.","October 1, 2001","2015-08-28 15:36:26","2015-08-28 15:36:26","2015-08-28 15:36:26","59-79","","1","67","","Kiva","New Insights into the Early Agricultural Period in the Tucson Basin","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2001 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/V27D4RNI/Roth and Wellman - 2001 - New Insights into the Early Agricultural Period in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pedogenic and paleoenvironmental significance of such features is not always easy to interpret because variations in size, structure, composition, and soil-geomorphic context have been used to infer distinct modes of genesis for features that appear similar. Using both optical and scanning electron microscopy, petrocalcic soil samples from the Jornada La Mesa geomorphic surface in New Mexico and the Mormon Mesa geomorphic surface in Nevada were studied to reconsider the formation of pedogenic ooids. In this paper, “ooids” are &lt; 2 mm in diameter and are comprised of concentrically alternating carbonate and fibrous clay laminae. “Pisoids” are &gt; 2 mm in diameter and have a range of internal morphologies. Ooids were especially common within features including clast pendant laminae, pisoids, and laminar horizons or laminar horizon caps. We propose a possible new mode of ooid genesis, suggesting that crystal growth can move ooids tiny, incremental distances over time, and that phyllosilicates are an important genetic component. Ooids are interpreted to form via: (1) mineralization during the evaporation of solutions held by surface tension around mineral grains, clasts, or petrocalcic fragments, with or without the presence of organic matter, (2) hydration and plastic behavior of pervasive, pedogenic, fibrous phyllosilicates that co-precipitate with pedogenic calcite, and (3) tiny, successive movements caused by the crystallization pressure of pedogenic carbonate and other minerals during soil solution evaporation. Spheroidal morphology is initially promoted by chemical precipitation from evaporating solutions around grains. Next, crystallization pressures from the surrounding matrix displace grains non-uniformly, promoting stochastic contacts or ‘knocking’ of ooids against one another and against the soil matrix. Over long time spans, this micrometer-scale, episodic translocation and rotation, in tandem with the plastic behavior of fibrous phyllosilicates, enhances the spherical shape of ooids. The model described here does not preclude possible biological contributions to ooid genesis, nor refute the role of other processes in producing similar features in the same soil. Finally, ooid size is limited by physical and hydrological thresholds. Pisoids, as larger features, are more complex and are more likely to involve erosion; they do not form in the same manner as ooids. This study has implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations of calcic and petrocalcic horizons, and for the selection of pedogenic features for isotopic analysis.","August 2015","2015-09-04 17:06:19","2015-09-04 17:06:19","2015-09-04 17:06:19","10-23","","","251–252","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; /home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/BF8MFBVA/S0016706115000804.html","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000804/pdfft?md5=b5b61ec02da7d99656110cf380e4ede1&pid=1-s2.0-S0016706115000804-main.pdf","","Carbonate; Micromorphology; Ooids; Phyllosilicates; Pisoids; Soil-genesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Associated features and the presence of nearby habitation sites independently corroborate the chronology of canal building. The geomorphology of the Zuni landscape and the morphology of the irrigation canals are consistent with the artificial construction of the canals. Pollen evidence points to an agricultural landscape and the cultivation of maize. /// La introducción del cultivo de maíz en el sudoeste de los Estados Unidos y en el altiplano de Colorado fue acompañada por técnicas de riego. El fechamiento de los canales de riego es establecido por 26 fechas de radiocarbono en dos sitios, K'yana Chabina y K'yawa:na'a Deyatchinanne, en el área del Pueblo de Zuni hace 3000 a 1000 años. La presencia adyacente de sitios de habitación y rasgos asociados confirman independientemente la cronología de construcción de canales. El examen de la geomorfología del paisaje de Zuni y la morfología de las canales indican la construcción por seres humanos.

The pedogenic and paleoenvironmental significance of such features is not always easy to interpret because variations in size, structure, composition, and soil-geomorphic context have been used to infer distinct modes of genesis for features that appear similar. Using both optical and scanning electron microscopy, petrocalcic soil samples from the Jornada La Mesa geomorphic surface in New Mexico and the Mormon Mesa geomorphic surface in Nevada were studied to reconsider the formation of pedogenic ooids. In this paper, “ooids” are &lt; 2 mm in diameter and are comprised of concentrically alternating carbonate and fibrous clay laminae. “Pisoids” are &gt; 2 mm in diameter and have a range of internal morphologies. Ooids were especially common within features including clast pendant laminae, pisoids, and laminar horizons or laminar horizon caps. We propose a possible new mode of ooid genesis, suggesting that crystal growth can move ooids tiny, incremental distances over time, and that phyllosilicates are an important genetic component. Ooids are interpreted to form via: (1) mineralization during the evaporation of solutions held by surface tension around mineral grains, clasts, or petrocalcic fragments, with or without the presence of organic matter, (2) hydration and plastic behavior of pervasive, pedogenic, fibrous phyllosilicates that co-precipitate with pedogenic calcite, and (3) tiny, successive movements caused by the crystallization pressure of pedogenic carbonate and other minerals during soil solution evaporation. Spheroidal morphology is initially promoted by chemical precipitation from evaporating solutions around grains. Next, crystallization pressures from the surrounding matrix displace grains non-uniformly, promoting stochastic contacts or ‘knocking’ of ooids against one another and against the soil matrix. Over long time spans, this micrometer-scale, episodic translocation and rotation, in tandem with the plastic behavior of fibrous phyllosilicates, enhances the spherical shape of ooids. The model described here does not preclude possible biological contributions to ooid genesis, nor refute the role of other processes in producing similar features in the same soil. Finally, ooid size is limited by physical and hydrological thresholds. Pisoids, as larger features, are more complex and are more likely to involve erosion; they do not form in the same manner as ooids. This study has implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations of calcic and petrocalcic horizons, and for the selection of pedogenic features for isotopic analysis.","August 2015","2015-09-04 17:06:31","2015-09-04 17:06:31","2015-09-04 17:06:31","10-23","","","251–252","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/Q856GEE9/Robins et al. - 2015 - Micromorphology and formation of pedogenic ooids i.pdf; /home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/CBI4D5V6/S0016706115000804.html","","","Carbonate; Micromorphology; Ooids; Phyllosilicates; Pisoids; Soil-genesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews the development of this reconstruction and considers the degree to which data from assemblages of Paleoindian flaked stone tools support it. Published information implies that patterns of raw material use vary greatly over the Plains, that bifaces were not the centerpiece of Paleoindian technology, that there are no published efforts to document an unusual degree of resharpening or recycling, and that the data that are available on these topics do not suggest that either was important. Detailed analysis of one assemblage, from the Allen site in southwestern Nebraska, carried out with these issues in mind, shows similar patterns. The great difference between what the literature says about Paleoindian technology and the documented character of that technology suggests that Paleoindian lifeways were far more variable than current discussions suggest.","2002-03","2015-10-15 19:58:30","2015-10-15 19:58:30","2015-10-15 19:58:30","55-98","","1","16","","Journal of World Prehistory","High-Tech Foragers?","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","; ","http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1014567313865.pdf; http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1014567313865#page-1","","Anthropology/Archaeometry; Archaeology; Folsom; Great Plains; lithic technology; mobility; Paleoindian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the mid-nineteenth century, southern Colorado, long a part of Spain and then briefly Mexico, was conquered by the expanding United States. Material remains and historic documents attest to its residents' ensuing struggles over place, identity, and citizenship. Bilingual newspapers proclaimed that the region's Hispanics, who continued to call themselves Mexicanos, were just as 'American' as residents of other new US territories. Yet much of their material culture was rooted in centuries-old Hispanic traditions. The archaeology of a late nineteenth-century Mexicano site in the region provides an example of how material culture, social ties, and landscape were mobilized by people for whom a former nationality became an ethnic identifier.","2005","2011-11-27 20:44:52","2011-11-27 20:44:52","2011-11-27 20:44:52","440-452","","3","37","","","Lived Ethnicity","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Historical Archaeology / Full publication date: Sep., 2005 / Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis, Ltd.","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/40024246.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"N6Z82PMA","book","2002","Krell, Alan","The Devil's Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire","","978-1-86189-144-0","","","","Barbed wire cuts across more than just property, war and politics. This most vicious tool of control has played a critical role in the modern experience, be it territorial expansion or the settlement of local and international conflicts. However, it has other histories: those constructed through image and text in the arts, media and popular culture. These representations – in painting, photography, poetry, personal memoirs, cartoons, novels, advertisements and film – have never before been critically examined. In this book, Alan Krell investigates the place barbed wire holds in the social imagination.   Invented in France in 1860, barbed wire was developed independently in the USA, where it was used to control livestock on the Great Plains, both to ""keep out"" and ""keep in"". Promoted as the Ideal Fence, barbed wire’s menacing qualities were soon made manifest. The epithet, ""The Devil’s Rope"", anticipated its transformation into a tool of war in the late 19th and early 20th century. Henceforth, it would become synonymous with repression. Barbed wire’s conflicting character makes it an appropriate symbol of modernity, and Krell shows how the use of this symbolism in contemporary art has given barbed wire meanings beyond the historical and political realms.","2002","2015-07-31 18:08:21","2015-07-31 18:08:21","","","228","","","","","The Devil's Rope","","","","","Reaktion Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.com/books?id=JSYby9zZri0C","","Art / General; Education / Multicultural Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines the reasons for the multiple primary origins of agriculture, looks at relations between hunter-gatherers and farmers, and addresses issues of agricultural adoption, the origins and dispersal histories of language families, and the dispersal histories of biological populations. It uses data from archaeology, comparative linguistics, and biological anthropology to cover developments over the past 12,000 years. The author offers discussion of regional agricultural origins in, and dispersals out of, these areas: the Middle East, central Africa, China, New Guinea, Mesoamerica, and the northern Andes. The linguistic survey covers the origins and dispersals of major language families such as Indo-European, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, and Uto-Aztecan.","2005","2015-08-28 12:57:29","2015-08-28 12:57:29","","","","","","","","First farmers","","","","","Blackwell Pub.","Malden, MA","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the process of working with clay, children learned about its properties and practiced some of the techniques used by the Sinagua for producing larger vessels. An intermediate stage in learning to become a competent ceramicist was to produce small-sized, but usable, ceramics.

The relations among tool roles, raw-material distribution, and mobility as well as the archaeological consequences of the different roles are key factors. An examination of temporal trends in the use of bifacial implements in the Carson Sink of western Nevada shows how the proposed perspective on lithic technology can help to elucidate change in mobility strategies. A shift from the use of bifaces as cores to an infrequent use of bifaces as tools suggests a shift from logistical to short-term residential use of the raw-material-poor Carson Sink; a later shift to the use of small, frequently unifacial, nonresharpenable points may indicate a shift to target-specific hunting strategies.","October 1, 1988","2015-08-05 22:33:33","2015-08-05 22:33:33","2015-08-05 22:33:33","717-734","","4","53","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1988 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/281115.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, the chronological patterning of projectile points in that portion of the Great Basin is poorly known. In the past, archaeologists frequently have used point chronologies established for other regions of the Great Basin to type and date surface points from the northeastern region. This study reports obsidian hydration results for 109 projectile points from northeastern Nevada. These data indicate that both Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene and Middle Holocene aged split stemmed points are present in northeastern Nevada at least as far west as Mary's River. Elko series points, however, may not have reached northeastern Nevada until the Middle Holocene. These interpretations have important implications for several models that account for the diachronic distribution of Great Basin point styles across the Great Basin.","January 1, 1995","2015-09-16 18:54:44","2015-09-16 18:54:44","2015-09-16 18:54:44","41-53","","1","17","","Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1995 Malki Museum, Inc.","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/8S3I5TT5/HOCKETT - 1995 - Chronology of Elko Series and Split Stemmed Points.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I consider the dialogue regarding these sites as part of a national problem regarding the interpretation of National Register eligibility, especially in the realm of CRM work. The current interpretations are dependent upon site significance and integrity, often failing to consider a site's historical context by utilizing single-level analytical methods and disregarding regional interpretations. This results in a considerable bias in the sites that are nominated to the NRHP, as the central issues of race and historical representation and variations in site type are ignored in favor of one-sided evaluation methods and a lack of regional interpretations. To address this bias, improved communication and education within and between CRM firms, government agencies, and academic institutions are needed to re-emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary research at historic sites.","January 01, 2004","2011-01-24 15:10:29","2011-01-24 15:10:29","2011-01-24 15:10:29","90-100","","1","38","","","Race, the National Register, and Cultural Resource Management","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: Transcending Boundaries, Transforming the Discipline: African Diaspora Archaeologies in the New Millenium / Full publication date: 2004 / Copyright © 2004 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25617134.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply this model to geochemical data from obsidian artifacts from three regions in western North America. As predicted, results show markedly different patterns in the geochemical composition of small flakes, large flakes, and formal tools. While small flakes and tools tend to have greater source diversity and are on average farther from their original source, the large flake assemblage is composed of fewer and closer sources. These results suggest that a failure to include very late stage reduction (e.g., pressure flakes) and microdebitage in characterization studies may bias interpretations about the extent of residential mobility and/or trade patterns because more distant sources will be underrepresented. /// Basado en un modelo sencillo de obtención, reducción y uso líticos, generamos predicciones para patrones de diversidad de fuentes y medidas de media-distancia desde las fuentes de colecciones de piedras talladas dejadas por poblaciones ambulantes. Aplicamos este modelo a los datos geoquímicos reunidos de artefactos de obsidiana procedentes de tres regiones norteamericanas-occidentales. Como era previsto, los resultados muestran patrones notablemente distintos en la composición geoquímica de las lascas pequeñas y grandes y de herramientas formales. Mientras las herramientas y lascas pequeñas suelen tener una mayor diversidad de fuentes y como promedio se encuentran más lejos de sus fuentes originales, las lascas grandes tienden a componerse de menos fuentes que también están más cercanas. Los resultados sugieren que el dejar de incluir reducciones (desbastes) y microdebitage (micro desechos) de las etapas finales (e.g., lascas de presión) en los estudios de fuentes, se puede sesgar las interpretaciones sobre la extensión/los límites de movilidad residencial y/o patrones de comercio porque las fuentes más lejanas quedan sub-representadas.","July 1, 2007","2015-08-05 22:26:22","2015-08-05 22:26:22","2015-08-05 22:26:22","585-597","","3","72","","American Antiquity","Reduction Strategies and Geochemical Characterization of Lithic Assemblages","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2007 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/40035862.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate these arguments and find their supporting evidence, when provided, meager and unconvincing. Fiedel y Morrow cuestionan nuestro argumento de que la tecnología Clovis se originó en las Planicies del sur o el Sureste, y desde allí fue llevada por las poblaciones que migraron hacia el norte. Al entrar al Oeste Intermontano relativamente tarde, se encontraron con una población que utilizaba una tecnología diferente (Western Stemmed), llegada de manera independiente desde la costa del Pacífico. Fiedel y Morrow ofrecen argumentos a favor de que la Clovis fue la primera tecnología en el Oeste Intermontano y la costa de California, y en contra de la ruta costera, los orígenes de la Clovis en el sur, y las diferencias tecnológicas entre Clovis y Western Stemmed. Evaluamos estos argumentos y encontramos que su evidencia de apoyo, cuando existe, resulta escasa y poco convincente.","April 1, 2012","2015-09-11 15:59:19","2015-09-11 15:59:19","2015-09-11 15:59:19","386-397","","2","77","","American Antiquity","CLOVIS AND WESTERN STEMMED AGAIN","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2012 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/9MNGRI7J/Beck and Jones - 2012 - CLOVIS AND WESTERN STEMMED AGAIN REPLY TO FIEDEL .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, researchers in the American Southwest have recognized that the adoption of agriculture by hunter-gatherers was part of a complex decision-making process. In this paper, I argue that one of the ways to get at the ""how"" and ""why"" of the adoption of agriculture is to start by looking at who did the adopting. Using ethnographic data from hunter-gatherers and farmers in arid lands and data from recent excavations at early farming villages on the floodplain of the Santa Cruz River, I explore the idea that gender was a critical variable in the decision-making process leading to the adoption of agriculture in the southern Southwest.","December 1, 2006","2015-08-27 14:57:41","2015-08-27 14:57:41","2015-08-27 14:57:41","513-538","","4","62","","Journal of Anthropological Research","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2006 University of New Mexico","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/BSQ4KFJG/Roth - 2006 - The Role of Gender in the Adoption of Agriculture .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the difficulty archaeologists face in developing theories of material culture, I suggest that guiding principles of engineering design offer potentially useful insights. In this article I discuss two design alternatives for optimizing the availability of any technical system - reliability and maintainability. Reliable systems are made so that they can be counted on to work when needed. Maintainable ones can easily be made to function if they are broken or not appropriate to the task at hand. Because these design alternatives have markedly different optimal applications and observably different physical characteristics, archaeologists can link the design of prehistoric weapons to environmental constraints and to specific hunting strategies. Ethnographic examples indicate that primitive hunters do use both reliable and maintainable systems in optimal situations.","October 1, 1986","2015-09-11 14:09:52","2015-09-11 14:09:52","2015-09-11 14:09:52","737-747","","4","51","","American Antiquity","The Optimal Design of Hunting Weapons","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1986 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/CIPV7JG8/Bleed - 1986 - The Optimal Design of Hunting Weapons Maintainabi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, age and sex distributions and dental morphology traits that reflect genetic affinity are used to argue that specific kin groups were buried in formal, spatially discrete cemeteries in the ancestral Zuni settlement of Hawikku. The inferred kin groups are then used to investigate Hawikku political structure. Results show that community leaders, identified on the basis of mortuary treatments and grave offerings, were selected from a small number of kin groups, suggesting an ascriptive element to leadership selection.","July 1, 1996","2013-08-09 22:21:47","2013-08-09 22:21:47","2013-08-09 22:21:47","537-554","","3","61","","American Antiquity","Archaeological Identification of Kin Groups Using Mortuary and Biological Data","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1996 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jul., 1996 / Copyright © 1996 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/281839.pdf?acceptTC=true","cluster analysis; methods; not read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early Holocene evidence of communities dominated by Douglas fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, and limber pine in the San Juan Basin calls for revision of traditional constructs based on fossil pollen. Middle and late Holocene vegetation in the canyon was pinyon-juniper woodland up until Anasazi occupation between 1000 and 800 years ago. Instead of climate, Anasazi fuel needs may explain the drastic reduction of pinyon and juniper after 1230 years ago. The lack of pinyon-juniper recovery over the past millennium has implications for contemporary forest and range ecology","November 1981","2015-10-23 18:45:13","2015-10-23 18:48:02","","656-658","","","","","","","","","","Science 6 Vol. 214 no. 4521","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ""consumer choice"" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the ""qualitative"" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.","January 1, 1996","2012-09-02 19:40:23","2012-09-02 19:40:23","2012-09-02 19:40:23","50-65","","4","30","","","Shopping as Meaningful Action","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: 1996 / Copyright © 1996 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616493.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter discusses some of the different outcomes that can be expected according to the differing perspectives of archaeology, linguistics, and biological anthropology. I argue that agriculturalist expansion lies at the root of many of the world's major language families, although this need not imply that farmers always replaced hunter-gatherers in the biological sense. History, enviromental variations, and prior cultural configurations dictated many of the outcomes, some of which played a fundamental role in the large-scale genesis of human cultural and biological patterning from Neolithic/Formative times into the world of today.","January 1, 2001","2015-08-28 12:48:49","2015-08-28 12:48:49","2015-08-28 12:48:49","181-207","","","30","","Annual Review of Anthropology","Early Agriculturalist Population Diasporas?","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2001 Annual Reviews","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/CJC6IQQ6/Bellwood - 2001 - Early Agriculturalist Population Diasporas Farmin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most recent of these is the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol, first suggested by Murray and Roberts. In this approach, each natural or regenerated dose OSL measurement is corrected for changes in sensitivity using the OSL response to a subsequent test dose (10-20% of De). If the sensitivity correction is adequate, then the corrected OSL response should be independent of prior dose and thermal/optical treatment, i.e. there should be no change in the sensitivity-corrected dose-response curve on remeasurement. Here we examine the interpretation of the sensitivity corrected growth curve as a function of dose, and the effect of changing measurement conditions (e.g. preheat temperature, size of test dose, stimulation temperature) on the estimation of De. The dependence of the dose response on prior treatment is tested explicitly, and the significance of thermal transfer discussed.

The unfired clay figurines from the Early Archaic deposits at these sites have been assigned to a new type called Horseshoe Shouldered figurines. These unfired anthropomorphic figurines are the earliest figurines in the Southwest, and have a suspected time range of 5600 to 5000 B.C /// De las excavaciones realizadas a mediados de la década de 1970 en las cuevas Cowboy y Walters al sureste de Utah se recobraron tipos desconocidos defigurillas de barro crudo.

The monitoring involved periodic HDS 3D (High-Definition Surveying 3D) laser scanning coupled with analysis of the status and scope of conservation work completed. The church was built at the turn of the 14th century. Following a long period of neglect, conservation work was initiated to restore this valuable historical monument. Recognition of the historical value of the building meant that conservation work was preceded with a HDS 3D laser scan of the whole interior of the church. Data from scanning provided geometry information, which formed basis for a numerical analysis (FEM) conducted prior to repair work. It was decided that the oldest and most damaged part of the church – its presbytery – would be monitored in the years following repair work in order to observe conservation effects. Methods used for strengthening and consolidation of cracked brick walls and vaults of the presbytery involved application of steel tie rods, as well as C-FRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) and C-FRCM (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Matrix) technologies.","December 15, 2014","2015-09-29 19:15:33","2015-09-29 19:15:33","2015-09-29 19:15:33","62-75","","","81","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029614005653/pdfft?md5=5f0d1f013dcfb237007eb9523bc76472&pid=1-s2.0-S0141029614005653-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029614005653","","C-FRCM; C-FRP; Church; HDS 3D; Heritage; Historical; Laser scanning; Masonry; Monitoring; Presbytery; Strengthening; Vault","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such comparison has been undertaken by archaeometric characterisation: mineralogical phase analysis, structure identification, and processing behavior. This study points out that interaction between farmers and hunter–gatherers homogenised the technological repertoires throughout the diverse cultural settings of the N.E. Congo Basin. Recent ceramic assemblages share with ancient ones a consistent distribution and manufacture of pottery across a multiethnic setting in which pottery is used by ethnically diverse slash and burn farmers and bow/net hunter–gatherers. The degree of technological continuity inherent to these assemblages is measurable by empirical means, the results suggesting that ancient and modern traditions have shared, now as then, the five components that make the Ituri pottery tradition insofar as raw material extraction, preparation of clays, modelling, drying, and firing are concerned.","February 2000","2013-08-09 22:48:54","2013-08-09 22:48:54","2013-08-09 22:48:54","163-182","","2","27","","Journal of Archaeological Science","Ceramic Tradition in the African Forest","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272428&_user=1550512&_pii=S0305440399904557&_check=y&_origin=article&_zone=toolbar&_coverDate=29-Feb-2000&view=c&originContentFamily=serial&wchp=dGLbVlB-zSkzS&md5=6a3645547192485dee5260c716215559&pid=1-s2.0-S0305440399904557-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science/article/pii/S0305440399904557","ceramic theory crown S08; technological style","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"S93JUDZA","book","2004","Claney, Jane Perkins","Rockingham Ware in American Culture, 1830-1930: Reading Historical Artifacts","","978-1-58465-412-4","","","","Rockingham ware was an inexpensive brown-glazed ceramic that was ubiquitous in America from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth century. Popular as an antique today, it is regularly sold at venues ranging from flea markets to antique shows. Despite its prevalence in American life for nearly a century and its continued presence as a collector’s item, little has been written on this subject of vast interest to collectors, museum curators, historians, and archaeologists.  Jane Perkins Claney has written the first and only full-scale study of Rockingham ware to consider not just its history as a manufactured object but also its role in domestic life. Both an artifact study and a case study in material culture interpretation, this volume offers a totally comprehensive approach to the study of Rockingham ware and serves as a model for future studies of similar objects.  Following a chapter on her methods of identifying and interpreting historical evidence, Claney describes the physical characteristics of Rockingham ware and its production history. She places Rockingham ware within the context of nineteenth-century design and discusses its ""Americanization"" by U.S. manufacturers. Turning next to usage and meaning, Claney shows how certain Rockingham-ware vessels were used in the expression and maintenance of cultural identity and the enactment of social roles. Exploring gender and class ramifications, she demonstrates that although the ceramic was used at all social-class levels and in all types of communities from urban to rural, the choice of vessel forms and decoration differed markedly. Rockingham-ware teapots, for example, were favored by working-class women and rarely appeared in middle-class homes, while middle-class men living in cities formed the market for Rockingham-ware pitchers decorated with hunting scenes. Rockingham-ware spittoons, on the other hand were used universally—even by women. With the specific cultural roles of Rockingham-ware vessels so clearly understood, the vessels themselves become texts through which to interpret the past.  The book features fifty halftones, fourteen of which are presented also in color, and an extensive archaeological database.","2004","2015-07-21 17:10:15","2015-07-21 17:10:15","","","220","","","","","Rockingham Ware in American Culture, 1830-1930","","","","","UPNE","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.com/books?id=UQjRRbMIF3MC","","Art / Ceramics; Design / Decorative Arts; History / United States / 19th Century; History / United States / 20th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the prolonged exposure to weathering, the lack of conservation measures and the misuse during war periods, many constructions collapsed or are prone to collapse. A new topography (1 m contour lines) of the site was produced using drone-derived 3D photogrammetry combined with GPS data. Then a detailed geomorphological survey of the whole site was carried out in order to identify the main geomorphic processes acting on the land surface and structures. GIS analysis allowed defining the internal drainage system of the studied area. The site is affected by incised erosional phenomena on the eastern side, while the hilltop is mainly hit by diffuse erosion and soil mobilization during snowmelt. Monument deterioration is coupled with the lack of an adequate drainage system to collect runoff. Ramparts located on the steep hillslopes are severely affected by gully erosion and siphoning, which cause depressions infilled by eroded and weathered building material. The access path is locally eroded or buried by debris cones. The western margin of the plateau has been rapidly retreating due to collapses, while the citadel is in danger due to diffuse or gully erosional processes developed on all its sides. A mitigation strategy with low environmental impact (ecosystem-based approach) is proposed in order to adopt sustainable, systemic and cost-effective tools for soil conservation, in order to improve the environmental resilience of the site.","June 15, 2015","2015-09-29 18:54:11","2015-09-29 18:54:11","2015-09-29 18:54:11","73-90","","","239","","Geomorphology","The conservation of the Shahr-e-Zohak archaeological site (central Afghanistan)","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15001191/pdfft?md5=07ab5154090a33251f4c3021e1db4a85&pid=1-s2.0-S0169555X15001191-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15001191","","Afghanistan; Archaeological site; Ecosystem-based mitigation; Geomorphological processes; Soil erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zooarchaeological and paleoethnobotanical data from three Pueblo villages that experienced different degrees of Spanish missionization are the focus of this study. In addition, human osteological data from one village provide important information on activity patterns and health. These data are used to document the kinds of changes that occurred in Pueblo labor patterns, food consumption, and health from the pre-colonial to colonial periods. Synthetic analyses document the development of some degree of inter-village specialization in large game hunting, hide processing, and corn farming, presumably in response to Spanish tribute levies in corn and antelope hides, and demands on Pueblo labor in other arenas. There also appears to be a degree of divergence in women’s and men’s lives in the colonial period. These southwestern data are then compared with similar information from the southeastern US to identify patterns of similarity and difference in Native American experiences of and strategies for dealing with Spanish colonization.","March 2009","2015-09-09 19:43:49","2015-09-09 19:43:49","2015-09-09 19:43:49","102-125","","1","28","","Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","“…being weary, they had rebelled”","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416508000482/pdfft?md5=b4ac524bfc8b94575e4f128d42defdac&pid=1-s2.0-S0278416508000482-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416508000482","","Colonialism; Diet; Gender; Health; Labor; Pueblo; Subsistence; US Southeast; US Southwest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For at least 7 k.y. prior to that time, climate, vegetation, and groundwater conditions were not conducive for arroyo formation along the floors of desert valleys. After a hiatus in arroyo formation, the frequency of arroyo cutting and filling increased dramatically after 4000 14C yr B.P. The early Holocene arroyos and increased frequency of arroyo incision after 4000 14C yr B.P. are related to the establishment and changes in postglacial vegetation, climate, and groundwater conditions. As a result, arroyo sequences preserve a record of large-scale climate change and small-scale climatic perturbations that occurred during the Holocene. Human modification of valley flood plains is an additional factor that contributed to mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century arroyo cutting.","05/01/2001","2015-08-28 13:58:26","2015-08-28 13:58:26","2015-08-28 13:58:26","399-402","","5","29","","Geology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","geology.gsapubs.org","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/PF32BECB/Waters and Haynes - 2001 - Late Quaternary arroyo formation and climate chang.pdf; /home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/8UNADUWH/399.html","","","arroyos; climate; Quaternary; southwestern U.S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The geographic extent of local Kinet wares (how local is local?) is established through comparison with sediment samples across the Kinet hinterland. Four major compositional groups are identified: local and locally imported wares, imports from Cypriot, and presumed Western Anatolian and Aegean centers, and imports that appear relatively homogenous elementally but comprise typologically diverse ceramics with attributions that range from Cyprus to the coastal mainland. Comparison with other published NAA studies for this site reinforces the elemental evidence for local production, and underlines the need for caution when assuming local production always equates with local clays particularly for coastal sites. We propose that the chronological distribution of the local and non-local groups provides a useful political economic proxy. The study indicates systemic and widespread political disruption and marginalization at the transition to the Late Iron Age in this region.","July 2008","2011-01-16 22:23:08","2011-01-16 22:23:08","2011-01-16 22:23:08","1974-1992","","7","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6WH8-4S0B2V6-1-1&_cdi=6844&_user=3097450&_pii=S0305440308000034&_origin=search&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2008&_sk=999649992&view=c&wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkWb&md5=a3ab05686f55c48d16e26f5963922f55&ie=/sdarticle.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WH8-4S0B2V6-1&_user=3097450&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1608951553&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000059771&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=3097450&md5=da5a7c2983fb31cf7e538fe1eed6f6a5&searchtype=a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we do not currently understand intraregional variation in respect to the exact timing, context, and nature of early maize agriculture. It appears that maize was integrated into local foraging economies, being cultivated in both lowland and upland contexts within the northern Rio Grande Valley. The period leading to the dependence on this cultigen was quite late in this region, setting the stage for complex forager-agriculturalist relationships. /// La dispersión de la agricultura temprana a través del suroeste estadounidense ocurrió rápidamente.

El período que conducía la dependencia de esta planta cultivada fue muy tardío en esta región, lo que le da empuje al desarrollo de unas relaciones complejas entre recolectores y agricultores.","December 1, 2007","2015-08-27 14:51:49","2015-08-27 14:51:49","2015-08-27 14:51:49","117-130","","2","73","","Kiva","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2007 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/EG44RJUG/Vierra and Ford - 2007 - Foragers and Farmers in the Northern Rio Grande Va.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Charles; Duff, Andrew Ian","The Protohistoric Pueblo World, A.D. 1275-1600","","978-0-8165-2343-6","","","","In the centuries before the arrival of Europeans, the Pueblo world underwent nearly continuous reorganization. Populations moved from Chaco Canyon and the great centers of the Mesa Verde region to areas along the Rio Grande, the Little Colorado River, and the Mogollon Rim, where they began constructing larger and differently organized villages, many with more than 500 rooms. Villages also tended to occur in clusters that have been interpreted in a number of different ways. This book describes and interprets this period of southwestern history immediately before and after initial European contact, A.D. 1275-1600Ña span of time during which Pueblo peoples and culture were dramatically transformed. It summarizes one hundred years of research and archaeological data for the Pueblo IV period as it explores the nature of the organization of village clusters and what they meant in behavioral and political terms. Twelve of the chapters individually examine the northern and eastern portions of the Southwest and the groups who settled there during the protohistoric period. The authors develop histories for settlement clusters that offer insights into their unique development and the variety of ways that villages formed these clusters. These analyses show the extent to which spatial clusters of large settlements may have formed regionally organized alliances, and in some cases they reveal a connection between protohistoric villages and indigenous or migratory groups from the preceding period. This volume is distinct from other recent syntheses of Pueblo IV research in that it treats the settlement cluster as the analytic unit. By analyzing how members of clusters of villages interacted with one another, it offers a clearer understanding of the value of this level of analysis and suggests possibilities for future research. In addition to offering new insights on the Pueblo IV world, the volume serves as a compendium of information on more than 400 known villages larger than 50 rooms. It will be of lasting interest not only to archaeologists but also to geographers, land managers, and general readers interested in Pueblo culture.","2004","2015-08-28 16:06:30","2015-08-28 16:06:30","","","234","","","","","","","","","","University of Arizona Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.com/books?id=fhVTpGYlFXEC","","History / Native American; History / United States / State & Local / General; Social Science / Archaeology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Archaeologists have inferred that rabbit drives occurred prehistorically as well, though evidence from the archaeological record is based primarily on ethnographic analogy, the recovery of game nets and associated tools (e.g., rabbit sticks), and ceramic motifs. Faunal remains have been largely omitted from evidence used to argue for prehistoric rabbit drives. The leporid (jackrabbit and cottontail) remains from a small logistical locale in southeastern Arizona are used to argue for the presence of a prehistoric rabbit drive based on butchering patterns, burning intensity, element representation, and the number of individuals present. /// Datos etnográficos de la Cuenca Grande y la mayoridad del sureste de los Estados Unidos han mostrado que el impelido de una manada de conejo fue un método de cacería comunal cual le suministró una gran cantidad de animales a una población particular en un solo episódio. Arqueólogos han inferido que los dichos impelidos ocurrieron prehistoricamente también, aunque la evidencia principal se presenta como analogía etnográfica, los hallazgos de trampas de cazay herramientas asociadas, y los motivos ceramicos. Los restos faunales se han omitido en gran parte como evidencia para sugerir la ocurrencia del impelido de manadas de conejo durante la época prehistórica. Restos de Leporid (liebres y conejos) de un local pequeño y logístico del sureste de Arizona (E. UA.) se utilizan para sugerir la existencia del impelido de manadas de conejo.

A recent technique of debitage analysis based on flake breakage categories (Sullivan and Rozen 1985) is used to demonstrate these effects in archaeological and experimental situations. These cases demonstrate significant variation in flake breakage patterns that can be attributed to raw material differences. Therefore, attempts to use these breakage patterns to infer past human behavior or technological process must control for the effects of different raw materials.","April 1, 1997","2015-08-05 22:22:26","2015-08-21 17:52:53","2015-08-05 22:22:26","18-32","","1","22","","Lithic Technology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1997 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/23273112.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.D. 1500-1775, has been hampered by a lack of datable materials and poor precision in radiocarbon results. Methods described in this paper use materials ubiquitous at early Navajo sites in northwestern New Mexico and employ a dual strategy involving tree-ring dating of nonarchitectural wood and thermoluminescence assay of ceramics and burned rock. Comparison of samples obtained from a number of sites near the Morris Site 1 pueblito indicates remarkable correspondence between tree-ring and thermoluminescence results. These techniques are argued to have considerable reliability for relatively recent cultural manifestations such as these early Navajo sites. Thermoluminescence in particular may be useful in protohistoric contexts where tree-ring dating is unavailable. The thermoluminescence technique has the added benefit of directly dating pottery sherds, which can be useful for developing ceramic cross-dating sequences.","January 1, 2002","2014-06-24 22:52:52","2014-06-24 22:52:52","2014-06-24 22:52:52","145-164","","1","67","","American Antiquity","Correspondence in Tree-Ring and Thermoluminescence Dating","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2002 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2694883.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although regional archaeologists have not focused on the issue, it is generally thought that the bow and arrow were introduced on the Columbia Plateau ca. 2,300 years ago and completely replaced the atlatl by 1000 B.P. We apply two sets of discriminate functions and four threshold values to three large projectile point samples from the Columbia Plateau and a control sample from the Western Great Basin. Our results indicate that the atlatl was used on the Plateau by ca. 10,800 B.P. While the bow and arrow may have been present by 8500 B.P., they were ubiquitous in the region by 4400 B.P. Atlatl use appears to have increased for a while after 3000 B.P. At the same time, metric differences between dart and arrow points strengthened. Darts became rare after 1500 B.P. but seem to have been in use in small numbers at least until contact. El momento de introducción y dispersión del arco y flecha así como su reemplazo por el atlatl constituyen importantes temas de investigación de la prehistoria de Norte América. Aunque los arqueólogos regionales no se han concentrado en este tema, en general se piensa que el arco y flecha fueron introducidos en la meseta de Columbia hace unos 2,300 años y que reemplazaron completamente al atlatl hacia 1000 a.P. En este trabajo aplicamos dos conjuntos de funciones discriminantes, cuatro valores de umbral y patrones de variación por tamaño a lo largo de tres dimensiones métricas a tres grandes muestras de puntas de proyectil de la meseta de Columbia y a una muestra de control de la Gran Cuenca occidental. Nuestros resultados indican que el atlatl fue utilizado en la meseta desde ca. 10,800 a.P. Asimismo, el arco y flecha pudieron ya estar presentes para el 8500 a.P. y ya eran ubicuos en la región hacia el 4400 a.P., aunque sin reemplazar completamente al atlatl. El uso del atlatl parece haberse incrementado por un tiempo con posterioridad a 3000 a.P. Al mismo tiempo las diferencias métricas entre puntas de dardo y puntas de flecha se hicieron más notables. Los dardos se tornaron raros después del 1500 a.P., pero parecen haber continuado en uso hasta tiempos del contacto. En suma, no se trata de una historia de reemplazo directo de un arma por otra, sino que ambos sistemas de armas estuvieron en uso al mismo tiempo durante varios milenios en la meseta de Columbia.","April 1, 2010","2015-08-21 16:52:22","2015-08-21 17:52:33","2015-08-21 16:52:22","287-325","","2","75","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2010 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/25766197.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a public that understands that the hypothetical and theoretical constructs that guide research are not value-free and are often, in fact, politically charged. An ongoing dialogue between the concerned community, the federal steering committee, the federal government, and the archaeological community has proved difficult but ultimately productive. The project has an Office of Public Education and Interpretation which informs the public through a newsletter, educators' conferences, and laboratory tours. The public, largely students, attends laboratory tours which often provide initial exposure to archaeology and physical anthropology. Much of this public involvement, however, was driven by angry public reaction to the excavation of a site of both historical prominence and spiritual significance.","January 01, 1997","2011-01-24 15:15:01","2011-01-24 15:15:01","2011-01-24 15:15:01","84-106","","3","31","","","Seizing Intellectual Power","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: In the Realm of Politics: Prospects for Public Participation in African-American and Plantation Archaeology / Full publication date: 1997 / Copyright © 1997 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616551.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the results of most debitage analyses are unconvincing because of questionable assumptions and inherent flaws in the typologies used to classify the material. After briefly reviewing these problems, we present an alternative approach that does not rely on the presumed technological origins of individual artifacts as the basis for debitage classification and interpretation. An important element of this approach is a typology composed of interpretation-free and mutually exclusive debitage categories. The derivation of this typology is described and the utility of the approach is demonstrated with two Arizona case studies. The TEP St. Johns project provides new data and interpretations about Archaic Period technological and settlement changes while the Pitiful Flats study illustrates how differences in functional and organizational factors affect debitage assemblage variability.","October 1, 1985","2015-08-21 17:29:07","2015-08-21 17:29:07","2015-08-21 17:29:07","755-779","","4","50","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1985 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/280165.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UGX57V8I","journalArticle","1999","Mathews, Karen Rose","EXPRESSING POLITICAL LEGITIMACY AND CULTURAL IDENTITY THROUGH THE USE OF SPOLIA ON THE AMBO OF HENRY II.","Medieval Encounters","","13807854","","","This paper will explore the significant role appropriated objects played in Ottonian artistic production through a close examination of the Ambo of Henry II. Created by the last Ottonian emperor for the Palace Chapel at Aachen between 1002 and 1014, the Ambo of Henry II abounds with spolia. I will argue that the spolia reused on the Ambo of Henry II presented an innovative statement of Henry II' political, economic, and cultural agenda. The spolia from ancient Rome and contemporary Byzantium portrayed Henry II as the political successor to an illustrious Roman past, and as an equal to the Byzantine emperors in the East. The luxury objects reused on the Ambo also served as commodities whose symbolic value increased dramatically when they were taken out of economic circulation and used on this precous artwork. Finally, the Islamic and Byzantine spolia on the Ambo allowed Henry II to define himself and his Western Roman Empire in terms of an Other, associating his rule with the power, prestige, and sophistication of contemporary and competitive foreign cultures.

This paper discusses the lithic material from eight small, noncommunal bison kills at the Lubbock Lake site in the Texas Panhandle. This collection differs fundamentally from those found in communal kills, particularly in the range of quality in the raw materials and in the diversity of tool uses present. The Lubbock Lake assemblage integrates curated tools of nonlocal stone and expedient tools of local stone into a tool kit which was used to exploit local resources needed during the hunt. This increased mobility and countered the uncertainty inherent in noncommunal hunting.","August 1, 1985","2015-09-11 13:58:28","2015-09-11 13:58:28","2015-09-11 13:58:28","243-258","","109","30","","Plains Anthropologist","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1985 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/QZMBPEAZ/Bamforth - 1985 - THE TECHNOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF PALEO-INDIAN SMA.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It evaluates how African American material discourses and consumption patterns subverted racial caricatures and pressed for African American civil rights and material opportunities. After the mid nineteenth century, caricatures of Black social behavior and material consumption were constructed in a wide range of popular discourses ranging from minstrelsy performances to travel accounts. These discourses and their powerful racist assumptions attempted to make all public space and civil privilege racially exclusive. White Americans and many aspiring European immigrants rapidly accepted that all difference should be interpreted through the lens of racial ideology, constructing a tacitly White racial backdrop against which all American class, cultural, and material difference was evaluated. Racial ideology rapidly was extended to a consumer marketplace which was itself transformed by an increased volume of commodities, new sales outlets and marketing techniques, and alluring promises to ease or erase social and material subordination. As in broader American society, racial ideology became the fundamental cornerstone of the nascent consumer culture, defining appropriate consumption patterns, casting a racial basis for material symbolism, and restricting African American privileges in public consumer space. Archaeological material culture from three sites in Annapolis, Maryland demonstrates how the civil and material aspirations of a series of African American households is reflected in the goods they consumed, their material exchange tactics, and the avoidance of certain commodities and marketers. Material culture and African American consumer discourses demonstrate that African Americans aspired to consumer culture's symbolic and material possibilities, were invested in many genteel values, and recognized consumer culture as a critical scene of racial struggle. Distinctive African American consumption tactics negotiated racist regulation, preserved African American cultural integrity, and undermined Black racial caricatures. African American consumers sought and often secured significant social and material opportunities, illuminated the precariousness of White identity, and subtly transformed African America's position in American society.","1996","2012-09-02 16:15:27","2012-10-20 19:42:32","2012-09-02 16:15:27","","","","","","","The contradictions of consumption","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScientificCommons","","","","","http://en.scientificcommons.org/43720415","African-American archaeology; consumption; need to read; race; theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of fine-ware bowl kiln wasters from the urban center of Leilan, Syria (ca. 2300 B.C.) provides a rare opportunity to test the standardization hypothesis against the archaeological record of a single production event. Scanning-electron microscopy, xeroradiography, neutron activation, and metric analyses of the wasters show extreme uniformity in manufacturing technology, chemical composition, and vessel dimensions. However, when contrasted with sherds of the same bowl type from other contexts at Leilan, a higher degree of compositional and metric variability is observed. This ""cumulative blurring"" effect stems from the use of long-lived types from multiple workshops. Although ""cumulative blurring"" increases sample variability, it does not obscure the overall homogeneity of these ceramics. Our results suggest that standardization can be a reliable index of craft specialization only under conditions of close spatial and chronological control over the archaeological record.","January 1, 1993","2013-05-19 15:33:00","2013-05-19 15:33:00","2013-05-19 15:33:00","60-80","","1","58","","American Antiquity","The Standardization Hypothesis and Ceramic Mass Production","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1993 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jan., 1993 / Copyright © 1993 Society for American Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/281454.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alluvial stratigraphic studies in Whitewater Draw showed that Sulphur Spring stage artifacts occurred in deposits ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 B.P. and may even date as old as 10,400 B.P. These studies also showed that Sulphur Spring artifacts were not temporally associated with Pleistocene megafauna. Re-examination of the late Quaternary stratigraphy of Lake Cochise showed that reported Sulphur Spring stage sites were not temporally associated with the Pleistocene shoreline and were younger than first reported. The Sulphur Spring stage of the Cochise culture should be regarded as the oldest recognized Archaic manifestation in southern Arizona. /// Los estudios de geoarqueolgía fueron emprendidos en el drenaje de Whitewater y alrededor del lago Cochise en el sureste de Arizona para determinar la edad de la etapa del manantial del sulfuro de la cultura de Cochise y para definar su lugar en la prehistoria del sudoeste. Los estudios estratigráficos aluviales en el drenaje de Whitewater mostraron que los artefactos de la etapa del manantial del sulfuro fueron encontrados en los depósitos que se extendian a partir del 8, 000 al 10, 000 antes del presente, y pueden incluso fechar tan viejo como el 10, 400 antes delpresente. Estos estudios tambien mostraron que los artefactos del manantial del sulfuro no fueron asociados temporalmente a la megafauna del Pleistoceno. La reexaminación del útimo estratigráfico cuaternario del lago Cochise mostró que los sitios señalados de la etapa del manantial del sulfuro no fueron asociados temporalmente al litoral Pleistoceno y fueron más jóvenes que primero señalados.

Episodes of cultural activity during the past 8,000 years, preserved within the cave, are correlated with alluvial events in an adjacent canyon. Preliminary analyses indicate that human occupation of both the canyon floor and the cave was determined by changing fluvial regimes. No cultural evidence was found in either the canyon or the cave during intervals of rapid aggradation and degradation, such as 600-900, 3,500-4,000, 6,3005,000 and +8,300 B.P.

More than 100 high-precision radiocarbon dates show that deposits containing artifacts and coprolites ranging in age from 12,450 to 2295 ¹⁴C years ago are well stratified. Western Stemmed projectile points were recovered in deposits dated to 11,070 to 11,340 ¹⁴C years ago, a time contemporaneous with or preceding the Clovis technology. There is no evidence of diagnostic Clovis technology at the site. These two distinct technologies were parallel developments, not the product of a unilinear technological evolution. ""Blind testing"" analysis of coprolites by an independent laboratory confirms the presence of human DNA in specimens of pre-Clovis age.

Attributes of availability such as abundance and quality of lithic raw materials condition the production of formal- vs. informal-tool types. Poor-quality raw materials tend to be manufactured into informal-tool designs. High-quality lithic raw materials tend to be manufactured into formaltool designs when such materials occur in low abundance. When high-quality materials occur in great abundance both formal- and informal-tool designs are manufactured. Other factors, such as residential mobility or sedentism, are found to be less-important determinates of lithic-production technology.","January 1, 1994","2015-08-05 22:23:05","2015-08-21 18:09:14","2015-08-05 22:23:05","21-34","","1","59","","American Antiquity","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1994 Society for American Archaeology","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/3085499.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because the artifacts were tentatively dated as 1,000 to 2,000 years old, natural weathering of some of the igneous and metamorphic rocks into masses of loose mineral grains was unlikely. Fragments of igneous boulders, found and broken apart at the site, were heated in the laboratory to 300° C or 500° C and cooled rapidly in water through six cycles. Those fragments heated to 500° C disintegrated into individual mineral grains if fractured mechanically. At the Oakwood Lake site, 66% of the rock arranged into circular patterns appeared to be fire cracked but only 56% of the randomly placed rock had this characteristic. Use of the cobbles and pebbles as ""pot boiler"" in cooking probably has hastened the natural weathering rate.","February 1, 1983","2014-09-17 15:37:10","2015-10-29 21:46:29","2014-09-17 15:37:10","53-57","","99","28","","Plains Anthropologist","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1983 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/25668335.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper will examine a pragmatically oriented project in Brazoria, Texas, USA, in which archaeologists and local citizens (including site descendants) have collaborated to create an Internet website to discuss the politically and emotionally charged archaeologies and histories of an eighteenth-century sugar plantation. It will discuss ways in which a pragmatic philosophical framework has given archaeologists new ways of approaching and 'conversing' about their data, and new ways of dealing, openly and non-hierarchically, with the communities most affected by their research. It will also discuss ways in which elements of post-processual archaeological theory - multivocality, interactivity, reflexivity and contextuality - were incorporated within both the content and delivery of the website, and will close with a short discussion about whether these strategies were effective in creating an open, relevant, democratic and multivocal discourse about archaeology.","2002","2013-08-09 22:27:28","2013-08-09 22:27:28","2013-08-09 22:27:28","303-314","","2","34","","","Archaeologies that hurt; descendants that matter","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0043824022000007116#preview","media; physical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussion is limited to prehistoric and protohistoric sites, 22 of which were excavated. The majority of the remains are small, surface aceramic sites that are believed to relate to the Archaic Cultural Complex. These sites reflect a specialized adaptive strategy focusing on seasonal mobility and the exploitation of resources occurring at or adjacent to sand dunes. The lithic assemblages from these sites generally are homogeneous and reflect opportunistic usage. Occupation of the project area during the Anasazi phases was limited. A considerable protohistoric Navajo occupation is apparent, with one excavated site suggesting a very specialized economic orientation emphasizing antelope procurement. The research focus of the project was on comprehensive lithic analysis and on paleoeconomy. Several methodological considerations are discussed, as is the necessity for developing a unified research perspective that will produce comparable data for the region.","July 1, 1983","2015-08-21 17:24:03","2015-08-21 17:24:03","2015-08-21 17:24:03","155-176","","2","10","","Journal of Field Archaeology","","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1983 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/529607.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Between 1867 and 1872 four Hispanic villages, based on an economy of irrigation, agriculture, and livestock grazing, were established in the middle Rio Puerco valley, northwest of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Within a decade, overgrazing in the larger Rio Puerco watershed initiated a process of erosion and entrenchment of the Rio Puerco that eventually led to the abandonment of three of the villages. The surviving village of San Luis has kept its sense of community alive despite environmental losses that brought an end to agriculture and severely limited the possibilities for raising livestock. San Luis's institutions of agriculture once provided its unique connection to place. The community now survives on faith, as it once survived on agriculture, and draws spiritual, if not actual sustenance from the land it hopes someday to reclaim.","April 1, 2004","2015-08-21 16:57:46","2015-08-21 16:57:46","2015-08-21 16:57:46","166-190","","2","78","","Agricultural History","From La Tijera to San Luis","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2004 Agricultural History Society","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/3744899.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We selected two sites that burned in high-severity fire decades ago and studied succession in the woody plant community and its variations across two environmental gradients; elevation and distance from a lower-severity/unburned edge. By overlaying an ordination of data for woody species on the modeled environmental gradient most closely related to variation in communities, we analyzed the interaction of life-history traits of species and landscape heterogeneity at each study site. Species that resprout from surviving roots were widespread across the distance gradient 28 years after the La Mesa fire in New Mexico. Species that reproduce from off-site seed, including Pinus ponderosa, were more prevalent where resprouters (e.g., Quercus) were less important in defining communities. At Saddle Mountain, Arizona, 45 years post-fire, we observed neighborhood interactions across the elevation gradient, for example, where shade-tolerant conifers (e.g., Abies concolor) occurred in understories of Populus tremuloides. At both sites, greater cover of woody plants that reproduce from off-site seed at shorter distances from a lower-severity/unburned edge suggested migration of these species following the model of wave-form succession. In contrast to studies that emphasize undesirable effects when forest transitions to openings and alternative habitats, our research elucidates the need for further consideration of both young forest communities and the persistent species and communities described as landscape scars in conservation plans for forest systems of the southwestern United States. /// Entender el papel que juegan los cambios de clima y de régimen de incendios en la sucesión de comunidades de plantas es crucial para planear la conservación a grandes escalas temporales y espaciales. Seleccionamos dos sitios que sufrieron severos incendios hace décadas y estudiamos los patrones de sucesión de sus comunidades de plantas leñosas y sus variantes a lo largo de dos gradientes ambientales: elevación y distancia al borde de un parche con baja incidencia de incendios o no quemado. Al superponer los resultados de la ordenación de los datos de especies leñosas sobre el gradiente ambiental del modelo más relacionado con la variación en las comunidades, analizamos la interacción de las características de la historia de vida de las especies con la heterogeneidad del paisaje en cada sitio de estudio. Veintiocho años después del incendio de La Mesa en Nuevo México, las especies que rebrotan de raíces supervivientes se distribuyeron a lo largo de todo el gradiente de distancia. Las especies que se reproducen por semillas procedentes de sitios exógenos, incluyendo Pinus ponderosa, fueron más prevalecientes allí donde las que rebrotan (por ejemplo, Quercus) tendieron a ser menos decisivas en la definición de las comunidades. En Saddle Mountain, Arizona, 45 años después del incendio, observamos interacciones entre vecinos a lo largo del gradiente de elevación. Por ejemplo, coníferas tolerantes a la sombra (como Abies concolor) se hallaron en el sotobosque de Populus tremuloides. En ambos sitios, la mayor cobertura de plantas leñosas reproducidas por semillas exógenas a poca distancia de bordes con parches con baja incidencia de incendios o no quemados, sugiere que la migración de dichas especies siguiera el modelo de sucesión ""forma de ola."" Al contrario de estudios que enfatizan los efectos no deseados de la transición de bosque a áreas abiertas y hábitats alternativos, nuestra investigación establece la necesidad de considerar conjuntamente las comunidades de bosque temprano al igual que las especies y comunidades persistentes descritas como cicatrices del paisaje en los planes de conservación de los sistemas de bosques del sudoeste de los Estados Unidos.","June 1, 2008","2015-09-10 14:24:44","2015-09-10 14:24:44","2015-09-10 14:24:44","146-161","","2","53","","The Southwestern Naturalist","Inhabitants of Landscape Scars","","","","","","","","Copyright © 2008 Southwestern Association of Naturalists","","","","JSTOR","","","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/20424909.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two documents of this period, an 1804 Spanish factura (shipping list) and the 1806-1807 account book of the smuggling ship Mercury, reveal differences in the types of items supplied by these two trade networks. Over the next quarter century the Spanish economic system in California would be replaced by the Anglo-based capitalist world economy. The effect of this trend on both Hispanic cultural ties and the material culture of the colony is discernible in these early inventories.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-24 15:26:02","2011-01-24 15:26:02","2011-01-24 15:26:02","59-66","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: The Archaeology of the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republican Periods / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616142.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adjacent uplands of the Rocky Mountains, however, recent investigations have focused on a number of late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic period sites containing artifact assemblages and facilities difficult to categorize in known Plains complexes. Some of these early materials have distributions largely limited to upland areas, and the lithic technology represented may be derived from the Western Pluvial Lakes or Stemmed Point Tradition of the Great Basin. Subsequent cultural continuity in high altitude areas of the mountains leads to the definition of a unique Archaic adaptation called the Mountain Tradition. This tradition is widespread in the Rockies during the late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic periods as far north as southern Montana, but Middle Archaic expansion of the McKean complex limits use of the term in the post-4500 B.P. era to the Southern Rocky Mountains. Archaic continuity in the Southern Rocky Mountains is expressed in archaeological remains as recent as 1000-700 B.P., after which explaining the presence of Numic sites may require a new influx of hunter-gatherer populations.","February 1, 1991","2015-09-03 16:12:42","2015-09-03 16:12:42","2015-09-03 16:12:42","1-29","","133","36","","Plains Anthropologist","Archaic Continuity in the Colorado Rockies","","","","","","","","Copyright © 1991 Maney Publishing","","","","JSTOR","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/MXZJDHFT/Black - 1991 - Archaic Continuity in the Colorado Rockies The Mo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frequently, for archaeologists studying the role of trade in the Spanish New World empire, the recovery of imported ceramics of non-Hispanic origins has suggested the presence of foreign interlopers in these closed mercantilist market-places. In this study, the ceramic assemblage of colonial Florida is examined against data from the larger Spanish empire to discern more parsimoniously the extent of this perceived illicit trade. Information for this paper is derived from the sites of colonial Santa Elena and St. Augustine in Spanish Florida, as well as from other contemporary Spanish colonial habitation and merchant shipwreck sites in the New World.","January 01, 1992","2011-01-24 15:28:07","2011-01-24 15:28:07","2011-01-24 15:28:07","109-118","","1","26","","","Empire and Ceramics","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: The Archaeology of the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republican Periods / Full publication date: 1992 / Copyright © 1992 Society for Historical Archaeology","","","http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/pdfplus/25616147.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article explores an online community devoted to museum education, Museum-Ed. After reviewing the history of online communities and the theory of communities of practice, the article presents a qualitative content analysis of one month of posts to this museum education community. Four themes emerged during the content analysis that relate to how this community functions. These themes include List Functionality, Professional Information, Human Relations, and Educational Resources. Because of the interactions that take place through this community, it is argued that Museum-Ed is an online community of practice. Through studying online communities, we may learn more ways to develop effective opportunities for developing communities of practice among educators.</p>","January 01, 2008","2011-04-28 21:57:16","2011-04-28 21:57:16","2011-04-28 21:57:16","43-52","","1(66)","34","","","Museum-Ed Listserv","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: 2008 / Copyright © 2008 University of Illinois Press","","","http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/20715460.pdf?acceptTC=true","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The maize pollen is from two prehistoric woodrat (Neotoma) middens that occur in fractures in the south-facing sandstone cliff at Chaco Culture National Historical Park. The diameters of the Archaic-age maize pollen grains are significantly larger than Puebloan and modern maize pollen. The size distributions of the earliest Zea grain populations are not normal, suggesting the possibility that more than one variety of maize is represented by the pollen. The occurrence of large numbers of maize pollen grains as well as pollen from weedy plants indicates the nearby presence of an Archaic cornfield, now buried in alluvial fill adjacent to the cliff. It was also found that the AMS radiocarbon ages of the pollen concentrations differ significantly from the age of twigs from the same woodrat middens. Because of the strong age differences of components of woodrat middens, pollen assemblages should be dated independent of plant macrofossils.","June 1, 2010","2015-08-27 16:13:34","2015-08-27 16:13:34","2015-08-27 16:13:34","125-137","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/SQKF4FRF/Hall - 2010 - Early maize pollen from Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, .pdf; /home/kris/.mozilla/firefox/72w7lie7.OCA-zotero/zotero/storage/4RBBQ9I2/01916121003675746.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Archaeological excavations at this site recovered material from the Meeting House backlot and a neighboring apartment building occupied by black tenants. These artifacts reveal strategies the community used to negotiate a place for themselves, create economic opportunities, and build community institutions. The Meeting House helped foster community success and became a powerful center for African American action on abolition, educational equality, and military integration. The present study argues that the archaeological and historical evidence from the African Meeting House demonstrates the power of the actions of individuals in the black community to counter widespread racial inequality with personal and community success.","2013","2013-04-08 19:06:29","2013-04-08 19:06:59","2013-04-08 19:06:29","119-142","","1","17","","Int J Histor Archaeol","Constructing Community","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu","","","","; ","http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10761-012-0212-z; http://link.springer.com.libproxy.unm.edu/article/10.1007/s10761-012-0212-z","community; historic archaeology; identity; race","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such an approach with the single observer grouping samples has a number of advantages, it is problematic when dealing with large numbers of samples. This paper aims to explore different coding systems and statistical analyses for grouping ceramic thin sections. In the example discussed a number of variables are defined, codified and analysed by correspondence analysis, classical multidimensional scaling, non-metric isotonic multidimensional scaling and Sammon mapping. The group separation is compared between methods and with previous non-automatic grouping of the same material. The results are promising for this approach, which can be adapted for different studies by the redefinition of the variables recorded and analysed.","September 2004","2013-04-11 18:14:17","2013-04-11 18:14:17","2013-04-11 18:14:17","1325-1338","","9","31","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","http://pdn.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272428&_user=1550512&_pii=S0305440304000457&_check=y&_origin=article&_zone=toolbar&_coverDate=2004--30&view=c&originContentFamily=serial&wchp=dGLbVBA-zSkWz&md5=47336b38b9dc14def12e403b8a89b98d&pid=1-s2.0-S0305440304000457-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.unm.edu/science/article/pii/S0305440304000457","","Ceramic petrology; Grouping; Late Roman Cooking Ware; Multiple correspondence analysis; Pottery; Principal component analysis; Thin section petrography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
